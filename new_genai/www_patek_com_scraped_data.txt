PATEK PHILIPPE SEAL
CALATRAVA CROSS
THE LAST INDEPENDENT, FAMILY-OWNED GENEVAN MANUFACTURE
A tradition of innovation
Patek Philippe has been pursuing traditional Genevan watchmaking artistry without interruption since 1839. The manufacture benefits from full creative freedom, which allows it to design, develop, and craft watches that connoisseurs consider to be the world's finest – as pledged by its founders Antoine Norbert de Patek and Adrien Philippe. In addition to exceptional skills, Patek Philippe also nurtures a tradition of innovation that has meanwhile been crowned by over one hundred patents.
A complete manufacture
Patek Philippe is an independent manufacture with vertically integrated production. It has its own research and development department and creates and engineers all movements and external components in its own workshops. The individual parts of the movements and cases are produced, finished, and assembled in-house, from simple models and complicated timepieces to grand complications. This competence accompanies each watch during its entire lifetime – from the first sketches to final assembly. Patek Philippe services and repairs all of its watches ever made since 1839.
A long-term strategy
The company has been owned by the Stern family since 1932 and today is managed by Thierry Stern (President), Philippe Stern (Honorary President), and Laurent Bernasconi (CEO). Philippe Stern shaped the history of the manufacture with ambitious real estate projects, the Patek Philippe Museum, and exceptional timekeeping instruments such as the Calibre 89. His son Thierry Stern is committed to safeguarding Patek Philippe's technological leadership to continuously improve the quality and long-term dependability of its timepieces.
The power of independence
Patek Philippe is sparing no effort to preserve its independence. Accordingly, the company relies on its own leverage to achieve growth, both as regards investing for the future and in its production resources. All major projects such as the manufacture in Plan-les-Ouates with the annex building, the exclusive salons in Geneva, Paris, and London, the Patek Philippe Museum and the ateliers and subsidiaries in the Jura region were fully self-financed. Patek Philippe's intention is to independently pursue the path that led to its success.

AQUANAUT
THE AQUANAUT COLLECTION
Modern, sporty and chic
When launched in 1997, the Aquanaut created a sensation. It was young, modern and unexpected. Its case was a rounded octagon, inspired by that of the Nautilus. And it sported a “Tropical” strap, made of a new composite material ultra-resistant to wear, salt water and UV radiation.

THE TWENTY~4 COLLECTION
Timeless Elegant Ladies Quartz & Automatic Watches

With 2018 marking the launch of the Twenty~4 Automatic, brand new models now complete the existing range.

THE COMPLICATIONS COLLECTION
A supreme test of ingenuity
A 'complication' in watchmaking is anything a mechanical watch might do beyond telling the time and simple date. Patek Philippe upholds a tradition in complications that are useful in everyday situations, such as Annual Calendars, dual time zones and World Time displays. At Patek Philippe, we enjoy unrivalled expertise in our knowledge and practice of this pinnacle of the watchmaker's art.

THE GONDOLO COLLECTION
The art deco spirit
With its rectangular, tonneau- or cushion-shaped cases, the Gondolo collection brings together most of Patek Philippe’s “form” watches, the term for all those that are not round. Their strong lines, timeless style and geometric simplicity are a contemporary interpretation of the art deco style, which coincided with one of Patek Philippe’s own golden ages. In introducing the Gondolo, Patek Philippe has reinterpreted – with a subtle infusion of modernity – some of the historical pieces that are part of its heritage and may be admired in the Patek Philippe Museum.

THE GOLDEN ELLIPSE COLLECTION
Perfect harmony
An elliptical case, between a circle and a rectangle. A dial in blue gold, with gold hands and hour markers floating over its depths. When it first appeared in 1968, Patek Philippe’s Golden Ellipse was a bold departure from traditional watch shapes. But far from bowing to fashion, this innovative watch had a sense of inner harmony that was very pleasing to the eye. Its design was inspired by the principle of the “golden section” discovered by the ancient greek mathematicians. This “divine” proportion, expressed as a ratio of 1 / 1.6181, forms the basis of some of history’s greatest works of art and architecture.

THE CUBITUS COLLECTION
Unmistakable elegance
In 2024, Patek Philippe introduces a brand-new collection, harmoniously blending boldness and elegance. From steel to rose gold, through platinum, the variety of materials presents an exclusive interpretation of the “casual chic” style. The distinctive shape of the square case, with an elegantly slender profile, is accentuated by the contrast between polished and vertical satin-brushed finishes. The dials feature a horizontal embossed pattern also picked up on the movements’ rotors and mini-rotors, as the signature of the models composing the new collection.

THE COMPLICATIONS COLLECTION
A supreme test of ingenuity
A 'complication' in watchmaking is anything a mechanical watch might do beyond telling the time and simple date. Patek Philippe upholds a tradition in complications that are useful in everyday situations, such as Annual Calendars, dual time zones and World Time displays. At Patek Philippe, we enjoy unrivalled expertise in our knowledge and practice of this pinnacle of the watchmaker's art.

THE GONDOLO COLLECTION
The art deco spirit
With its rectangular, tonneau- or cushion-shaped cases, the Gondolo collection brings together most of Patek Philippe’s “form” watches, the term for all those that are not round. Their strong lines, timeless style and geometric simplicity are a contemporary interpretation of the art deco style, which coincided with one of Patek Philippe’s own golden ages. In introducing the Gondolo, Patek Philippe has reinterpreted – with a subtle infusion of modernity – some of the historical pieces that are part of its heritage and may be admired in the Patek Philippe Museum.

THE GOLDEN ELLIPSE COLLECTION
Perfect harmony
An elliptical case, between a circle and a rectangle. A dial in blue gold, with gold hands and hour markers floating over its depths. When it first appeared in 1968, Patek Philippe’s Golden Ellipse was a bold departure from traditional watch shapes. But far from bowing to fashion, this innovative watch had a sense of inner harmony that was very pleasing to the eye. Its design was inspired by the principle of the “golden section” discovered by the ancient greek mathematicians. This “divine” proportion, expressed as a ratio of 1 / 1.6181, forms the basis of some of history’s greatest works of art and architecture.

THE CUBITUS COLLECTION
Unmistakable elegance
In 2024, Patek Philippe introduces a brand-new collection, harmoniously blending boldness and elegance. From steel to rose gold, through platinum, the variety of materials presents an exclusive interpretation of the “casual chic” style. The distinctive shape of the square case, with an elegantly slender profile, is accentuated by the contrast between polished and vertical satin-brushed finishes. The dials feature a horizontal embossed pattern also picked up on the movements’ rotors and mini-rotors, as the signature of the models composing the new collection.

THE NAUTILUS COLLECTION
Sporting elegance
With the rounded octagonal shape of its bezel, the ingenious porthole construction of its case, and its horizontally embossed dial, the Nautilus has epitomized the elegant sports watch since 1976. Forty years later, it comprises a splendid collection of models for men and women. In steel, rose gold, white gold or two-tone combinations they accompany the most active lifestyles with incomparable class.

Modern, sporty and chic
When launched in 1997, the Aquanaut created a sensation. It was young, modern and unexpected. Its case was a rounded octagon, inspired by that of the Nautilus. And it sported a “Tropical” strap, made of a new composite material ultra-resistant to wear, salt water and UV radiation.

CHAPTER 1
THE PATEK PHILIPPE PHILOSOPHY ON CHIMING WATCHES
ONLY AN ENDURING FAMILY PASSION CAN DELIVER THE PUREST OF CHIMES
From 1839 to today, Patek Philippe has a long history and passion for chiming watches. The collection was crowned in 2020 when the manufacture delighted enthusiasts and collectors by releasing a wristwatch that features a highly coveted and extremely elaborate sound function: the Grande Sonnerie, Ref. 6301P.
The Stern family believe the purity of sound in Patek Philippe’s chiming watches should do more than mark time, they should contribute to the unique character of each watch. Having personally listened to every single chime over generations, they take great pride in ensuring that a Patek Philippe minute repeater or grande sonnerie will never sound like any other.
INTRODUCING THE GRANDE SONNERIE REF. 6301P
Patek Philippe’s first wristwatch with a grande sonnerie in its purest manifestation

2
The Grand Complication that every connoisseur has been waiting for.
Patek Philippe reasserts its position as the grand master of chimes with the introduction of a truly exceptional timepiece, combining a grande sonnerie - rated as the holy grail of chiming functions in such pure form , a petite sonnerie, a minute repeater and a jumping subsidiary seconds. All elegantly housed in a platinum case with a grand feu black enamel dial.
The new, 703-part caliber GS 36-750 PS IRM features six complications, a strikework with three classic gongs and was granted three patents.
A NEW CHAPTER - THE PATEK PHILIPPE SOUND
The 1989 launch of the manufacture's first minute repeater movement developed and crafted entirely in-house, the caliber R27, created the platform for the return of modern repeater timepieces. Patek Philippe now present one of the most extensive minute repeater collections.
The presentation of the Grandmaster Chime in 2014, now followed by the new Ref. 6301P as part of the regular collection, the manufacture has started a new chapter that paves the way for new developments in the field of grande sonneries – much to the delight, aesthetically and acoustically, of all connoisseurs and aficionados who are passionate about chiming watches.

GOLDEN ELLIPSE
THE GOLDEN ELLIPSE COLLECTION
Perfect harmony
An elliptical case, between a circle and a rectangle. A dial in blue gold, with gold hands and hour markers floating over its depths. When it first appeared in 1968, Patek Philippe’s Golden Ellipse was a bold departure from traditional watch shapes. But far from bowing to fashion, this innovative watch had a sense of inner harmony that was very pleasing to the eye. Its design was inspired by the principle of the “golden section” discovered by the ancient greek mathematicians. This “divine” proportion, expressed as a ratio of 1 / 1.6181, forms the basis of some of history’s greatest works of art and architecture.

THE BEAUTIFUL ROOMS – THREE SALONS, IN THREE ICONIC CITIES
In three world cities, Patek Philippe has chosen to open graceful and inviting showrooms. Each is an expression in stone and glass of the company and the watches it makes, each one reflects the character of its location, and each is distinctive and special…not unlike the customers who visit
THE SALONS
GENEVA
PARIS
LONDON
THE PATEK PHILIPPE SALONS
GENEVA
The Geneva Salon could perhaps be called the first among equals. It was in 1853 that Patek Philippe, needing larger premises as the firm grew, moved into two stories of a building on the rue du Rhône.
Here the company entered into a fifteen-year agreement that has so far lasted for more than one hundred sixty years; the site has become an enduring part of the city landscape.
PARIS
The city of Paris has a special significance for Patek Philippe, for it was here, in 1844, that Antoine Norbert de Patek met Jean Adrien Philippe, and a piece of history was made.
Nevertheless, it was not until 1986 that Philippe Stern decided to open the company’s first salon outside Geneva. It was situated on the Avenue Montaigne, a prestigious destination but one given over, for the most part, to haute couture.
LONDON
London has become, perhaps, the crossroads of the world; a fast-paced, vibrant city where tradition meets the utterly modern. Fittingly, the Patek Philippe Salons sits on a crossroads in the very center of Bond Street – that lively, fashionable hub for visitors, browsers, and shoppers; and a byword for cultivated good taste.

COMPLICATIONS
THE COMPLICATIONS COLLECTION
A supreme test of ingenuity
A 'complication' in watchmaking is anything a mechanical watch might do beyond telling the time and simple date. Patek Philippe upholds a tradition in complications that are useful in everyday situations, such as Annual Calendars, dual time zones and World Time displays. At Patek Philippe, we enjoy unrivalled expertise in our knowledge and practice of this pinnacle of the watchmaker's art.

OUR COMMITMENT
OUR COMMITMENT
SERVICE COSTS
IMPORTANCE OF MAINTENANCE
STEPS OF SERVICING
Patek Philippe’s commitment to customer service is an indispensable element of its activities. This includes our pledge to service, repair, or restore any Patek Philippe timepiece regardless of its age.
We want to provide service at the highest possible level. This ambition is one of the fundamental criteria of the Patek Philippe Seal.
PATEK PHILIPPE SEAL
Our commitment is also expressed by the care with which we select the most talented specialists. As a family-owned enterprise, we strive to make them full-fledged members of our company as regards its values, it heritage, and of course its future.
Every professional who cares for a Patek Philippe watch must duly respect the product, its history, and its owner. We consider each watch to be as unique as its owner.
You have the assurance that your watch always benefits from the care and attention it needs to preserve its value and integrity across generations.
TECHNICAL TRAINING
“We are convinced that in our family-operated manufacture, the know-how required for servicing, repairing, and restoring our watches is just as important as the competence needed to craft new watches. For this reason, we place great emphasis on having this work performed exclusively by watchmakers who have been trained and certified by Patek Philippe.”
Patek Philippe president Thierry Stern explains that this commitment, or rather obligation, dates back to the year 1839 and reflects Patek Philippe’s respect for artisanal techniques, traditions, and expertise.
Professional repairers must be proficient in disassembly, observation, assessment, gemsetting, adjustment, mechanical optimization, polishing, assembly, and quality control. They must also master the use of tools and special lubricants and be thoroughly familiar with old and current Patek Philippe timepiece models.
The training courses for internal and external Patek Philippe watchmakers take place at Patek Philippe’s workshops in Geneva. As a rule, 2 to 5 years of professional experience are needed to complete one of our training programs, even for first-level curricula. The objective in training is to acquaint participants with the special technical features of our watches, to outline the quality criteria of the Patek Philippe Seal, and to update their knowledge base when our products undergo refinement and new models are integrated in our collections.
The training programs are organized on the basis of the levels described below. All watchmakers who have completed a program must apply their new skills in practice for at least 36 months before attending a next-level program.
TRAINING LEVELS
Essential Maintenance: All sales support operations, battery replacements, diagnostics of quartz and mechanical watches.
Classic: Full overhaul of quartz, manual and automatic movements with date, small seconds or moon phase.
Complications: Full overhaul of complications such as Annual Calendar, World Time, Travel Time.
Grand Complications: Full overhaul of Grand Complications such as Perpetual Calendar, Chronographs.
The mentioned training programs do not incorporate our Restoration activities.
All watchmakers who have not attended training programs for four years or more are required to attend refresher courses that acquaint them with the state of the art. The goal is to maintain the highest quality levels in repairs.
Patek Philippe also adopts a forward-looking attitude by partnering with watchmaking schools in Switzerland and around the world. They help us recruit promising talent for our in-house training, sustainably preserve horological know-how, and keep rare artisanal professions alive.

RARE HANDCRAFTS
The Contemporary Collection
As heir to the grand Geneva tradition, Patek Philippe is dedicated to preserving all the Rare Handcrafts that have been used to decorate timepieces for more than four centuries. What better way could there be to safeguard these ancestral skills for the future than by practicing them regularly?
The result is exceptional creations — pocket watches, wristwatches or table clocks — often one of a kind, that showcase these fine crafts on the brink of extinction, sometimes with the aid of the few specialists who still master the secrets of these skills.
The Marquetry
The Gemsetting
The Guilloché
Marquetry
In the course of their career, miniature marquetry specialists build up a range of wood varieties enabling them to craft their creations. They perceive in the wood veins and colors exactly how they can put each tiny piece of veneer to good use.
Marquetry is a decorating technique traditionally used for furniture, small wooden objects, woodwork and cabinets. Its use in watchmaking is relatively recent.
When marquetry experts study a landscape or the silhouette of an animal, they imagine how they will instill life and movement into their work. They make a line drawing which they then use to cut out the contours. According to their inspiration and the patterns chosen, they use their entire palette of wood, mostly in natural colors, which they cut and assemble, glue and paste.
Gemsetting
A row of diamonds or other stones can change the appearance of a watch by adding a touch of refined distinction. Watchmaking meets Haute Joaillerie in the delicate art of gemsetting, which requires accurate vision and a deft touch.
Gemsetting involves assembling and fixing stones or diamonds on a piece of jewelry or a watch. The gemsetting on Rare Handcrafts watches is entirely hand-crafted by the gemsetter, who ensures the brilliance of each stone by positioning them in the right direction with great precision and regularity. Timepiece makers have always worked closely with jewelers, especially since, historically speaking, many watchmakers came from this field.
However, gemsetting serves to enhance timepieces and has thus had to adjust to the constraints of watchmaking. Ultra-thin movements; new, sometimes unlikely alloys; decorations applied to every part of the watch from bracelet to dial as well as the lugs, case middle and bezel: all these elements influence the choice of gemsetting techniques.

Guilloché
Guilloché work is a decorative technique that, thanks to mechanical machines driven by human hands, offers the possibility of creating magnificent, very fine and regular engraved decorations on dials, movements, cases and bracelets, among others.
Over time, guillocheurs, or engineturners, have used different types of machines, modifying them where necessary in order to improve them or to create new motifs.
By turning the crank with the left hand and simultaneously managing the pressure of the burin (graver) with the right hand, the principle is to keep the latter moving so that it makes narrow grooves in a geometric and repetitive way.

Enamel
The magic of enamel happens in the furnace, where the material fuses with metal. Enamellers are like alchemists, mastering metal, colors and fire to create an objet d’art that will endure through the ages.
Enamel is a soft material composed of various minerals and metal oxides used to cover the surface of the medium by fusion in order to achieve a vitrified, uniform, glossy and smooth layer.
The enameller grinds the enamel into very fine grains and washes it several times to remove impurities. The substance is then mixed with water so that it can be applied to carefully prepared surfaces. At this stage, there must be no trace of imperfections if one is to achieve a uniform, clear and smooth enamel.
Once dried, the enamel is placed in a furnace heated to over 800°C, thus enabling it to adhere to the metal base while becoming extremely hard and virtually inalterable. Depending on the complexity of the technique chosen, an object can be returned to the furnace up to 30 times. Once finalized, enameled decorations are known for their exceptional protection against oxidation, their lasting brilliance and their enduring resistance.

Engraving
The delicate art of hand engraving enables the most refined decorations to emerge from the metal by playing with light. In watchmaking and jewelry-making, the engraver’s work is carried out under a binocular microscope, at a scale requiring the greatest attention.
Of all the fine craftsmanship skills, engraving is the closest to free-hand drawing, except the paper is replaced with metal and the pencil with a burin (graver), which is the engraver’s main tool. It is kept sharp and represents a natural extension of the engraver’s hand, penetrating the material to make clean cuts or sculpt volumes.
Depending on the work to be done, the engraver will choose the most suitable tool and will need to make it for a particular project.
On its Rare Handcrafts models, Patek Philippe likes to include engraving as it enhances the beauty of micro-marquetry or enamel work.

THE CUBITUS COLLECTION
Unmistakable elegance
In 2024, Patek Philippe introduces a brand-new collection, harmoniously blending boldness and elegance. From steel to rose gold, through platinum, the variety of materials presents an exclusive interpretation of the “casual chic” style. The distinctive shape of the square case, with an elegantly slender profile, is accentuated by the contrast between polished and vertical satin-brushed finishes. The dials feature a horizontal embossed pattern also picked up on the movements’ rotors and mini-rotors, as the signature of the models composing the new collection.

MOVEMENTS
MANUAL WINDING
SELF-WINDING
QUARTZ
MANUAL WINDING
As the name implies, these movements are wound by turning the crown. The tensioned mainspring drives the wheels inside the watch as it gradually relaxes. Whether ultra thin, cut-away “skeleton”, simple or complicated, the manually wound movement is greatly appreciated by aficionados of traditional watchmaking.

THE MUSEUM
PLAN YOUR VISIT
A TEMPLE TO WATCHMAKING
Inaugurated in November 2001, the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva houses one of the world’s most important and prestigious horological collections.
Some 2,500 watches, automata, precious objects and portrait miniatures on enamel invite the visitor on a fabulous voyage through five centuries of Genevan, Swiss and European horological art, as well as proposing a panoramic view of Patek Philippe’s production since 1839. The museum also has a library with over 8000 publications on time and time measurement.
An extraordinary collection
The Patek Philippe Museum was born of a man’s passion for horology. That man is Philippe Stern, honorary president of the Geneva manufacture, who little by little built up one of today’s most extraordinary horological collections. In doing so, he intended to share his love of the watchmaking art, communicate the splendor of Geneva’s high-watchmaking tradition and ensure that this cultural heritage would be handed down to future generations.
MORE THAN 500 YEARS OF HOROLOGICAL HISTORY
Rather than a museum devoted to a single brand, the Patek Philippe Museum is unique in that it offers the chance to discover five centuries of horological heritage, as well as the significance for all the decorative arts traditionally associated with watchmaking – engraving, enameling, gemsetting, guilloché work etc.
The collections are divided into two complementary sections: The Antiques Collection and the Patek Philippe Collection.
The Antiques Collection
(XVIème – XIXème siècle)
A fascinating presentation of Genevese, Swiss and European watches and enamels dating from the 16th to the early 19th century, including a great number of masterpieces that have left their mark on the history of horology.
1
2
The Patek Philippe Collection
(1839 - present)
An evocative showcase of watches designed and created by Patek Philippe since its foundation in 1839 up to the present day, testifying to more than 175 years of creativity in the production of pocket watches and wristwatches.

2
A BUILDING IN THE GRAND STYLE
The Patek Philippe Museum finally greeted the world in a magnificent industrial building dating from 1919–1920. Acquired by Patek Philippe in 1975 to house Ateliers Réunis - a production unit making cases, bracelets and chains - the building was left vacant in 1996 when these activities moved to the new manufacturing premises in Plan-les-Ouates.
Philippe Stern decided that this was where he would present the Antiques collection and the Patek Philippe Timepieces from the Museum. Between 1999 and 2001 the structure was fully restored, adding an additional floor.
Mr. Stern’s wife Gerdi oversaw the interior decoration, her aim being to give the rooms the warmth and intimacy of a private residence.
In November 2001, the Patek Philippe Museum collections were at last unveiled, in surroundings worthy of their technical, artistic, aesthetic, historical and scientific value.

SAVOIR-FAIRE
THE HUMAN TOUCH: THE IRREPLACEABLE SKILL OF HAND-FINISHING
The jewel in the crown of a Patek Philippe watch is the fact that, from its case and dial to its beating heart, it has been finished by hand by a dedicated, trained specialist, with skills passed down through generations.
ATTENTION TO DETAILS
MINUTE REPEATERS
RARE HANDCRAFTS
1 - WHAT IS HAND-FINISHING?
A wide array of fine decorations and subtle enhancements, which enrich the functionality and aesthetics of our pieces, as well as ensuring beauty and precision of a Patek Philippe watch for years to come.
Hand-applying the white gold numerals (Ref. 5370P)
Hand-enameling the dial (Ref. 5370P)
Hand-finishing the platinum case (Ref. 5370P)
Hand-finishing the movement components (Caliber CHR 29-535 PS)
Hand-applying the rose gold numerals (Ref. 7200R)
Hand-polishing the gold case (Ref. 7200R)
Hand-finishing the movement components (Caliber 240)

What is hand-finishing?
The term “hand-finishing” includes a wide array of fine decorations and subtle enhancements, painstakingly manually performed on watch components once they’ve come from the machine that produced them.
Finishing smoothes away any tiny burrs or traces of machining that may impede perfect movement; hones edges that will move against each other; protects against oxidation; and the different processes also transform dull metal into a material of burnished, alluring beauty.
It goes without saying that, whether a particular process ensures the flawless running of the watch for years to come or is purely aesthetic, hand-finishing of any kind calls for hard-won knowledge of centuries-old techniques – as well as great dexterity, since it’s often carried out on minuscule surfaces you’d struggle to see with the naked eye.
Hand-finishing expertise is also part and parcel of the stunning range of rare handcrafts produced by Patek Philippe, where this artistry is employed to craft exquisite enameled wristwatches, glorious dome table clocks, and collectible pocket watches featuring marquetry, or enameled or gem-set cases and dials. 
The Patek Philippe Seal
The connoisseur watch will have an elaborate, jewel-like finish performed entirely by hand, with an ingenuity, vigilance, and respect no machine on earth can replicate – which is why Patek Philippe stands unmatched in its field.
It’s a standard of excellence that is embodied in the Patek Philippe Seal, the benchmark applied to all mechanical watches that guarantees the company’s quality criteria – the strictest in Swiss watchmaking – have been met.
Every single detail is taken into account to achieve the best conceivable result. All elements of a timepiece (including the movement, the inside and outside of the case, dial, pushpieces) are immaculately finished.
Methods range from beveling and polishing to the handsome circular graining, or the gently abrasive pressing that results in the famous, rippling Geneva stripes (“Côtes de Genève”).
These deft procedures may be the most time- and labor-intensive part of the watch.
