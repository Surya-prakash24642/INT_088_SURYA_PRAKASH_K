We will then provide you with a quote for a 20\40 ft. container (one or more) from the Netherlands to the destination port. If you choose to use the services of one of our shipping partners, the costs will be added to your shopping list. Please look at our Terms and conditions.

They’ve finally arrived. Now all that is left to do is to have fun with your new furniture. Let us know how the experience has been for you and send us photos – we’d love to see the end result. If you have any feedback, feel free to contact our team at international.sales@inter.ikea.com.
