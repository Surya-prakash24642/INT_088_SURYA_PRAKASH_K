Identity
VUARNET
Jean Vuarnet’s legacy extends beyond the Mountains as an innovator and creator. He forged a Legend in the French Alps and US Moutains since 1957. As a renowned athlete, Jean won in 1960 the Olympic gold medal in ski racing. And he also pushed the boundaries on various other Alpine disciplines
inventing new ski technology, the Egg « Shuss » position, a car free Alpine Resort, the best eye protection in Altitude.
Vuarnet has its values and spirit deeply rooted into the sacredness of the Mountains. Worshipping such environment constitutes the very genesis of Vuarnet’s style.
In 2023, Vuarnet integrates LVMH through Thélios, the Group’s eyewear expert.
Vuarnet has a unique history, with a founder who is a French legend. Its iconic design, its unique know-how on mineral lenses and its brand purpose, are strong values that deserves to be preserved and perpetuated.

ICON
The legend of Vuarnet originated in the mountains, and the Glacier has been its emblem since 1974. This iconic eyewear reflects Vuarnet's history and craftsmanship, ensuring top-notch protection in all kind of situations. Widely embraced by famous mountaineers, the Glacier stands as a reliable companion for those navigating high altitudes.

SAVOIR-FAIRE
The details of the Vuarnet signature, exemplified by the “V sur Ski” emblem meticulously engraved on each mineral glass, reflect the heritage of over six decades of the Maison’s Savoir-Faire. Crafted by skilled artisans in the Vuarnet factory in France, the mineral glasses are fashioned using manufacturing techniques that have remained unchanged since the brand’s inception. These lenses, composed of 100% natural and recyclable materials, exhibit unparalleled durability and resistance to scratches. Employing Lynx™ technology, Vuarnet mineral glass not only provides high-definition vision but also ensures exceptional longevity and optimum protection against the sun’s rays.

Dom Pérignon is Vintage only. In the darkness of the cellars, inside the bottles, each Vintage goes through a slow transformation in contact with the yeast. It takes no fewer than eight years of elaboration to reach a harmonious dialogue between the character of the year and the signature of Dom Pérignon. The champagne showcases a perfect equilibrium, revealing the harmony.

ICON
Our premium aged Tequila Cristalino is blended in casks from the old world to create a unique and deep flavor.
INSPIRATION
A delicate balance of heritage and modernity transforms our agave into tequila.
The complexity of the Volcan de mi Tierra tequila comes from blending the distinct flavors of the highlands and lowlands agave, bringing together the best of both regions into an extraordinary liquid. Like generations before us, we wait and we watch as the agave sweeten in the sun.
Then, the use of a mampostery oven and slow fermentation in wood tanks combined with state-of the art processes develop a tequila with unparalleled flavor and aroma.

Ardbeg’s untamed island home of Islay, has an abundance of soft water, fertile soil and precious peat – making it a prolific producer of distinctive, world-famous whiskies. The Ardbeg Distillery perches on its wild south coast. Islay is a land steeped in history. Celtic monks, raiding Norsemen and 19th-century smugglers have all played their part in Ardbeg’s story. Islay’s dramatic past lives in the brand to this day.
INSPIRATION
Ardbeg is known as the “ultimate Islay malt”. Of all the Islay malt distilleries, it is Ardbeg that most encapsulates the natural aromas, tastes and the “feel” of Islay. The smell of heather-clad peat bogs, tarry rope, smoky bonfires and Atlantic winds full of salty sea spray can all be discovered in a glass of Ardbeg. Ardbeg’s dark and irreverent personality encapsulates the long history of the distillery, its Scottish provenance and the wildness of Islay.

Ardbeg’s creativity is born of these rich Islay cues and is expressed through a unique “Ardbeggian” attitude and a level of passion instilled in its fans, rare with other malt whisky brands. Every May sees the celebration of “Ardbeg Day” around the world, inspired by Islay’s Feis Ile Festival. This annual event offers fans globally the chance to join together at Committee events and celebrations, from the underwater events with Ardbeg Kelpie in 2017, to the Ardbeg “punk Ardcore” celebration in 2022.

Identity
KRUG
The House of Krug was established in 1843 by Joseph Krug, a visionary with an uncompromising philosophy. His dream was to craft the very best Champagne possible every single year, regardless of annual variations in the weather. He was able to fulfill his dream by paying close attention to the unique character of the vineyard, respecting the individuality of each plot and the wine it produced, and by building an extensive library of reserve wines from many different years.
Combining so many wines from different years produces a richness of flavors and aromas that would be impossible to express with only the wines of a single year. And thus was born the very first Édition of Krug Grande Cuvée, the most generous expression of champagne.
Six generations of the Krug family have perpetuated this dream, continually enriching the founder’s vision and savoir faire.
We have inherited the Krug philosophy from our founder, Joseph Krug. He transcended the traditional boundaries of making champagne to create the highest possible quality champagne each and every year, regardless of changes in the weather from one year to the next. At Krug we harvest each plot separately to produce a unique wine that expresses all the nuances of its personality. This art of individuality  allows the Tasting Committee and me to each year create a new Édition of Krug Grande Cuvée, the most generous expression of champagne.

Identity
Joseph Phelps
The story of Joseph Phelps Vineyards began fifty years ago when Joe Phelps, a construction magnate and home winemaker, founded his eponymous winery in the then undiscovered wilds of Napa Valley in 1973. A pioneering spirit and continued quest for excellence guided the winery’s path to purchase vineyard land in key areas of Napa Valley, and later the western Sonoma Coast. Today, Joseph Phelps Vineyards and its flagship wine Insignia uphold a legacy of extraordinary quality.

ICON
It began with a vision. In the early 1970s, Napa Valley was a sleepy agricultural town on the brink of a fine-wine awakening. Drawing on his construction experience, Joseph Phelps set about establishing the building blocks of winemaking excellence. Joseph Phelps was a builder of buildings, a builder of people, and a builder of dreams.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
It began with a vision. A belief in the possibility of something bigger and better – something that didn’t quite exist yet. In the early 1970s, Napa Valley was a sleepy agricultural town on the brink of a fine-wine awakening. Drawing on his construction experience, Joe set about establishing the building blocks of winemaking excellence. In 1974, he had the idea to make a unique blend each year, one that would represent the finest wine he could make from each vintage. His only thought was to make one wine that represented the best of Joseph Phelps Vineyards. Today, Insignia is widely regarded as a qualitative benchmark for California winemaking that has earned Joseph Phelps its longstanding reputation for excellence.
STYLE & RANGE
Joe Phelps built the winery’s early reputation on Cabernet Sauvignon and Rhône-style bottles, but his winemaking ambitions did not rest there. Today, the portfolio includes both Napa Valley and Sonoma Coast vineyards allowing our winemakers to explore the finest of each region.

Creation date

Headquarters
24, rue de Sèvres, 75007 Paris - France
Identity
LE BON MARCHÉ RIVE GAUCHE
Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche was the first department store in the world. It opened in 1852 in Paris at the instigation of Aristide Boucicaut and his wife Marguerite. They were both in favor of “a new kind of store that would thrill all the senses”. Combining unconventionality and elegance, this unique space designed by the architect Louis-Charles Boileau and the engineer Gustave Eiffel displayed a singular style influenced by the creative vitality of Paris’s Rive Gauche. Original creations and limited editions stood alongside a selection of the most beautiful objects from all over the world. Women’s, men’s and children’s fashion, accessories, tableware and design, but also cultural exhibitions, furniture collections and contemporary works of art filled the space and generated surprise. Here, as in the beginning, discovery and amazement are the foundations of a way of life that transforms shopping into an art de vivre.
Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche, Paris’s landmark department store, continues to uphold its pioneering position. It pays very particular attention to the selection and display of a unique and often exclusive array of brands and products that delights our discerning clientele, be they Parisian or cosmopolitan.

ICONS
When they became owners of Le Bon Marché in 1852, Aristide and Marguerite Boucicaut instigated an extraordinary period of change at the department store. The couple tested commercial methods based on a subtle understanding of customer behavior. At the same time they strove to improve the living and working conditions of their employees.
INSPIRATION
A patron of the arts, the department store, located at 24 rue de Sèvres, is also an exhibition space where talent, curiosity, a love of beauty and a taste for discovery create a constant dialog. Bringing art to Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche gives clients a unique experience. With over 80 pieces, the collection of contemporary art and furniture of the 20th and 21st centuries created by established and emerging artists is exhibited throughout the store. This collection offers the chance to enjoy an aesthetic and educational journey to the heart of contemporary creation. This approach – unique among department stores – is testament to Le Bon Marché’s desire to combine emotion and amazement in one exceptional space.

Identity
OLEHENRIKSEN
At age 19, Ole developed cystic acne, which improved dramatically with a regimen of exfoliation and replenishment. After studying skincare in London, he moved to Los Angeles and became the world’s first celebrity facialist, opening a namesake spa that became famous for giving clients his signature “The Ole Glow.” This inspired him to bottle his gentle yet powerful formulas and launch his eponymous skincare line, OLEHENRIKSEN, in 1983.
Notre héritage scandinave et notre engagement au profit du bien-être cutané sont renforcés dans chacun des produits que nous créons. Nous utilisons des actifs puissants, reconnus cliniquement, ainsi que des ingrédients nourrissants, riches en antioxydants, trouvés dans les plantes, les fleurs et les eaux scandinaves.

Identity
REPOSSI
High jewelry and jewelry house Repossi has carried on a family tradition of distinctive creativity for three generations. This family jewelry tradition dates back to the origins of the Maison in Turin in 1957, where Constantino Repossi, after studying industrial design, opened his first boutique.
The story continued when his son Alberto gave Repossi an international dimension by moving to Monte Carlo at the end of the 1970s, becoming the official jeweler to the Monegasque royal family. From the glamour of the 1980s to the avant-garde elegance of Paris – where the Maison opened its boutique on Place Vendôme in 1986 – Repossi resonates with its times, continually renewing its offering with a fresh vision of jewelry.
Repossi’s emblematic codes have been re-energized by Alberto’s daughter Gaia Repossi. Under her artistic direction Studio Repossi has reinvented traditional jewelry, melding primitive jewelry with modern art and architecture in bold pieces that become wearable art.
Our workshops do things the same way they did 100 years ago, but with new technologies, a perfect combination of the old and new worlds.

ICON
The “Serti sur Vide” collection, launched in 2014, embodies the ultimate reinvention of  the iconic classic jewelry piece: the solitaire ring. Diamonds are set on a hidden structure and float above the skin as if suspended, revealing the purity and brilliance of the gem. This design resonates with time-honored traditional jewelry craftsmanship. Serti sur Vide has become a Repossi signature, proposing a captivating avant-garde setting for precious gemstones.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Established since 1986 in the center of Place Vendôme, Repossi infuses each creation with its unique jewelry savoir-faire. Pieces are exclusively handcrafted in France and Italy as Repossi carries on a 40-year heritage of meticulous craftsmanship.
The Maison has worked with the same Italian workshops for generations, guaranteeing technical expertise and unerring quality. Repossi uses only the highest quality gemstones in its jewelry creations, mainly diamonds, but also colored diamonds and emeralds.

ICON
The Place du Marché fruit and vegetable section was created in the spirit of French covered markets to highlight the regular new arrivals of fresh fruits and vegetables. Located at the heart of the bakery, meat and fish counters, it offers a unique visual and tasting experience.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
The heart of La Grande Épicerie de Paris also beats beneath the earth: in the basement, an area of 1,500 m² provides the workspace for a Meilleur Ouvrier de France, 62 artisans and 12 expert apprentices in bakery, catering and pâtisserie. Every day, the same actions are repeated thousands of times with the same passion: a first batch of baguettes is baked in the early morning, followed by four others throughout the day, dishes from all over the world are prepared as well as an array of macaroons…
Moved in part from the shadows into the light, the laboratories of La Grande Épicerie de Paris also display their savoir-faire on the rue de Sèvres and the rue du Bac. Under the gaze of passers-by, the chocolatier molds bespoke chocolate bars to order, the pâtissier dresses his creations with finishing touches and the baker places one of 60 varieties of bread in the oven.
The artisans inspire, both in their show laboratories and behind their appropriate counter. In each specialty workshop they become sales representatives serving the public, equipped with their traditional tools, exceptional products and with their laboratory as a backdrop. Their delight? Sharing their savoir-faire.

Identity
FENDI
The Fendi Maison was established by Adele and Edoardo Fendi in Rome in 1925. The opening of the first Fendi boutique – a handbag shop and fur workshop followed. Soon winning international acclaim, Fendi emerged as a brand renowned for its elegance, craftsmanship, innovation and style.
Called by the legendary five Fendi sisters, the collaboration with the late Karl Lagerfeld began back in 1965 and lasted 54 years. In 1992, Silvia Venturini Fendi seconded him in the Artistic Direction; in 1994, she is given the direction of Accessories and later of Menswear.
In 2000, the LVMH group acquires Fendi becoming in 2001 its majority shareholder. Appointed in 2020, Kim Jones held the role of Artistic Director of Couture and Womenswear until 2024. Since 2020, Delfina Delettrez Fendi, fourth generation of the Fendi family, is Artistic Director of Jewellery. Today Fendi is synonymous with quality, tradition, experimentation and creativity.

ICONS
Savoir-faire and limitless creativity combined with the research for high-quality materials and details are the secret behind the Fendi Icons, the Baguette and Peekaboo bags. Created by Silvia Venturini Fendi respectively in 1997 and 2008, these creations have not only passed the test of time but have become a symbol of the Maison itself.
MAGICAL FASHION SHOWS
Fendi has always looked beyond the expected for its shows.
In 2007 Fendi was the first Maison to stage a show on the Great Wall of China.
In 2016, the 90 years of the Maison were celebrated with a unique show at the Trevi Fountain.
In 2019, Fendi paid homage to Karl Lagerfeld by presenting its Couture show at the Temple of Venus and Rome.

FIRST IN FUR
Fendi cultivates the most elevated craftsmanship, creating furs with its unique savoir-faire. This high attention to handcrafting the most extraordinary furs is a pursuit that has endured for nearly a century, producing a legacy of unprecedented invention and creativity in the art of fur.

Since 1925, fearless experimentation with precious fur has driven the creation of Fendi’s collections, combined with the incomparable technical prowess, extraordinary quality of materials and the Maison’s unparalleled creativity.

In the hands of the Fendi artisans and with the use of new techniques, fur becomes light, soft and versatile: the material of a new realm of fashion experimentation.

Identity
CLOUDY BAY
The Cloudy Bay story began in 1985 with the first vintage of its distinctive, captivating and vibrant Sauvignon Blanc. Established by Cape Mentelle founder David Hohnen, Cloudy Bay was one of the first five wineries in the Marlborough region.
Cloudy Bay now produces Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pelorus méthode traditionnelle from its Marlborough vineyards. The quality and diversity of these wines stand as proof of Marlborough’s pedigree as a wine region.
Never content to rest on its laurels, Cloudy Bay has endeavoured to explore new frontiers. Te Koko, a barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, launched in 2000 and changed how the world saw the region’s signature grape variety.
In 2009 Cloudy Bay embarked on a new adventure, finding a second home in Central Otago. It is here Cloudy Bay exclusively produces the serious, sophisticated Te Wahi Pinot Noir.
From the beginning, the estate has focused on creating captivating wines that evoke a sense of place. With vineyards in Marlborough and Central Otago, Cloudy Bay’s wines are an invitation to discover New Zealand’s natural wonder.
In Cloudy Bay vineyards & winery, our people treasure the wine with meticulous attention to detail, striving always to enhance the pure, distinctive flavors and stunning vibrancy naturally afforded its Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.  By enjoying a glass of Cloudy Bay, you start a journey of purity and immerse yourself in the natural beauty of our terroir.

Cloudy Bay’s legacy began with Sauvignon Blanc. A flagship New Zealand wine since its first vintage, it is world-famous for its quality and consistency.

Cloudy Bay’s Sauvignon Blanc vineyards sit across three sub-regions in the heart of Wairau Valley. Free-draining gravelly soils and the valley’s maritime climate come together in harmony to create the perfect conditions for growing Sauvignon Blanc grapes.

The resulting wines are pure, vibrant and full of concentrated stone fruit, citrus and subtle tropical characters. This is the Cloudy Bay benchmark style.
ARCHITECTURE
The Shack is a place for guests to enjoy the laidback luxury and down-to-earth lifestyle of Cloudy Bay.

Opened in 2012, the Shack sits on the site of the original wooden bungalow lived in by Cloudy Bay founder David Hohnen. Fire destroyed the original building in 2009, so the Estate commissioned architects Tim Greer and Paul Rolfe to create a replacement: a new, contemporary and iconic Shack.

Inspired by traditional New Zealand “bach” holiday homes, the new Shack is built from weathered steel, wood, stone and glass. The interior showcases the best of Aotearoa New Zealand art and design. New Zealand-made furniture, fittings and materials appear throughout.

The layout features a comprehensive kitchen, open living spaces and four queen ensuite bedrooms. These luxurious suites reflect the local environment: the Cape Suite, the River Suite, the Mountain Suite and the Cloud Suite. The building faces vistas of the Richmond Ranges, a breathtaking silhouette that adorns the Cloudy Bay wine label.
EXPERIENCES
Cloudy Bay’s cellar doors in both Marlborough and Central Otago offer more than wine tasting. Visitors can enjoy seasonal menus, private tours and bespoke experiences around the vineyards and wider region. Cloudy Bay also offers premium self-sufficient accommodation at The Shack in Marlborough.

ICONS
Since their inception, the TAG Heuer Carrera and the TAG Heuer Monaco have stood as beacons of innovation in the watchmaking world, donned by legends of motorsports who forged their successes with these icons on their wrists. Born in 1963, the TAG Heuer Carrera is renowned for its timeless elegance and emphasis on legibility, embodying the essence of classic yet contemporary design. It graced the wrists of racing's finest, from Niki Lauda to Ronnie Peterson, during their monumental victories. The TAG Heuer Monaco, introduced in 1969, broke new ground with its unique square case and status as the first water-resistant automatic wristwatch. It achieved legendary status as Jo Siffert raced wearing it in 1970, and it was immortalized by Steve McQueen in the movie "Le Mans." Both collections, revered for their innovative spirit and enduring appeal, continue to captivate collectors and enthusiasts alike.

Identity
CHÂTEAU GALOUPET
Château Galoupet is a future-facing wine estate that spans 77 hectares of protected woodland and 69 hectares of vineyards. Listed as a Cru Classé since 1955, the estate was acquired by Moët Hennessy in 2019, the first Rosé de Provence estate in its portfolio. Château Galoupet’s vision is to craft elevated expressions of an exceptional terroir, with unyielding respect for nature and the environment from ground to glass. For five years, the team has worked closely with a community of experts to restore a rare ecosystem and adapt its viticultural practices to respect the natural balance of the vineyards within their environment. The estate aims to express the full potential of the terroir in a sanctuary for biodiversity, becoming a benchmark for sustainability within LVMH, recognized for exemplary environmental practices in the wine industry.
At Château Galoupet, we respect our terroir by creating delicious dry, aromatic and velvety wines that reveal the grandeur of rosé and capture the essence of the Mediterranean. Beyond our organic practices, we are committed to innovative, regenerative viticulture, from vineyard to glass.

A UNIQUE ECOSYSTEM
Nature thrives in the Château Galoupet ecosystem and plays a vital role in the vineyards, from the vines to the protected woodland. Château Galoupet works closely with local organizations to identify and inventory the diverse array of species found on the estate.
The "Conservatoire des Espaces Naturels" is conducting an audit of all the biodiversity in the woodlands, while the "Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux" is doing the same in the vineyards. In partnership with the OFA (Observatoire Français d'Apidologie) beekeeping research organization, a hundred beehives have been created, enabling bees to contribute to the balance of fragile habitats, both enriching biodiversity and producing honey.

CRU CLASSÉ
Following several years of meticulous work to regenerate the estate’s natual environment and enable elevated expressions of the terroir, our Château Galoupet Cru Classé wine – one of the Provence region’s 18 classifications – fully reveal the superb results obtained from the estate’s harvests thanks to the year-round efforts of our vineyard managers. This gastronomic rosé, certified organic, reveals the complexity and richness of our terroir, offering a generous body and a long, saline finish, ideal for pairing with refined dishes.
RESPECTING THE ENVIRONMENT, FROM SOIL TO GLASS
Château Galoupet is proactively committed to respecting its terroir by adopting sustainable practices such as agroforestry and cover crops, which encourage biodiversity and support the presence of insects that benefit the vines. Château Galoupet Cru Classé Rosé is bottled in an amber glass bottle made from 85% recycled glass. The second cuvéee, G de Galoupet, is one of the lightest wine bottles in the market, weighing just 300 grams, halving its carbon footprint compared with a standard rosé bottle.

HISTORY
LVMH was created in 1987 through the merger of Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton, ushering in a new era for the luxury industry.
Bernard Arnault has led the Group since 1989 and is the majority shareholder, pursuing a clearly focused vision: make LVMH the world leader in luxury. An unprecedented portfolio of iconic brands makes LVMH unique in the world, a Group that has continued to grow and thrive since its founding.
LVMH's development initially centered on acquiring brands, bringing them the benefits of  the Group's proven expertise, nurturing their growth while respecting their distinctive identities. All LVMH Maisons share a strong belief that the desirability of their products is intimately linked to their sustainability. This is why LVMH has always ensured that product manufacturing complies with the highest ethical, environmental and social standards.
Corporate philanthropy in support of the arts and culture has been a cornerstone of the Group since its creation and a guiding force behind its development. This philanthropy resonates with the values of skilled professionalism, excellence and creativity shared by our Maisons, values that characterize their artistic, cultural and social contributions. Initiated by Bernard Arnault in 2006, the Fondation Louis Vuitton opened to the public in 2014, a breathtaking embodiment of the philanthropy pursued by the Group and its Maisons.
With 75 Maisons in key sectors of the luxury industry—Wines & Spirits, Fashion & Leather Goods, Fragrance & Cosmetics, Watches & Jewelry, Selective retailing and Other activities, including Hospitality and Media—LVMH is now the world leader in luxury. The Group's economic footprint in the regions where it operates—80 countries around the world—extends far beyond simply business performance by creating value at multiple levels thanks to our activities.

The one and only Premier Grand Cru Supérieur awardee in the 1855 classification, Château d'Yquem tells the story of a remarkable expertise that has been passed down since 1593.

A citizen of the world, constantly traveling between his native Florence and the holiday resorts favored by the jet set, he envisioned the modern woman following a revolutionary intuition full of style and personality.

Founded in 1952, Connaissance des Arts is the leading magazine for art from all eras, from archeology to contemporary art, from the art of gardening to photography, and from design to architecture.
2001

With our unique business model, a presence across the entire value chain, and its extensive production and retail resources, LVMH has a broad range of positive impacts on the economic and social fabric, both direct and indirect, as well as beneficial economic externalities.
LVMH’s business performance is joined by an extensive social, environmental and cultural engagement. Year after year, LVMH deepens its commitments through robust long-term policies, actively supported by all LVMH Maisons and their people.
Our performance also enables us to proactively support causes we believe are just. This commitment informs and indeed often exceeds the framework of our corporate citizenship responsibilities.

True business success stories are those that stand the test of time and contribute to buildinga sustainable society. At LVMH, and at ourMaisons, this is a longstanding conviction. It is embodied on a daily basis through our products, our commitments and all our actions

LVMH, A KEY ASSET FOR THE FRENCH ECONOMY
LVMH asked the Asterès consulting firm to calculate the economic impact and all the socio-economic flows generated by LVMH in France.
LVMH’s business activities in France generated €58 billion in revenue: 1 euro of Group sales generates 1 euro of business activity in the rest of the French economy.
LVMH counts 39,900 employees in France, while the Group’s economic impact totals more than 214,300 jobs (full-time equivalent).  This means that each job at LVMH generates 4.4 additional jobs for the French economy.
In terms of tax payments, LVMH’s total  impact was €8.1 billion in France in 2023, an increase of 50% compared with 2019. This includes corporate taxes paid directly by the Group in France, as well as various production taxes and value-added tax (VAT).
LVMH Group exports in 2023 were valued at €23.5 billion, representing 4% of aggregate French exports of goods, making LVMH the 11th-largest French exporter.
LVMH’s total economic footprint in France represents 1.1% of French GDP.

Identity
LE PARISIEN
Following the liberation of Paris in August 1944, Emilien Amaury and fellow members of the resistance movement founded Le Parisien Libéré, which became Le Parisien in 1986. Initially a regional daily newspaper, it became a nationwide publication in 1994 with the creation of Aujourd’hui en France.
Le Parisien has progressively expanded its presence across all media channels.
In addition to a special business and economy supplement each Monday, Le Parisien publishes a weekend section on Friday, as well as a monthly women’s magazine, La Parisienne. The website and mobile applications enable readers to access complete news and an array of services anywhere, at any time.
Le Parisien provides its readers with comprehensive information thanks to a team of 400 journalists, including 140 who work for the 9 regional editions (Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-De-Marne, Yvelines, Essonne, Val d’Oise, Seine-et-Marne, Oise).

The premium quality of the raw materials it sources is one of the keys underpinning the desirability of LVMH’s products and its responsibility framework. Since Scope 3 emissions account for 96% of the Group’s carbon footprint, the Purchasing Department and the Environmental Development Department are looking to build new, more sustainable supply chains. Specific actions are undertaken as part of the social program. The Group endeavors to ensure its suppliers and their service providers uphold human rights and to support them with applying the best possible employment, health, and safety conditions.
OVERSIGHT OF THE PURCHASING POLICY

The Group Purchasing Department and the Maisons’ purchasing teams have ultimate responsibility for quality, cost management and sourcing lead times. Their responsibility also extends to compliance by all the Group’s value chains with the Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Commercial Partners. This Code lays down the ethical and social and environmental responsibility requirements that LVMH sets for its partners, its suppliers and their subcontractors. One of the tasks of the Responsible Purchasing Committee, which is made up of Maisons’ purchasing managers and key strategic supply chain managers, is to monitor compliance with the Group’s environmental and human rights commitments.
IDENTIFYING RISKS AND MAKING PROGRESS TOGETHER
For some considerable time, LVMH has implemented an integrated supplier evaluation and support program fostering the common pursuit of excellence. Given the diversity of its activities and its global footprint, the Group adapts its approach to the individual situations it encounters. Its vigilance framework is based on the maps carried out by the Maisons and a global map. The risks analyzed reflect its commitments to human rights, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. Target Identify priority action areas and support suppliers in making continuous improvements to their practices.

LVMH has also made training for employees and its suppliers the linchpin of its responsible purchasing program. The program’s environmental aspects were expanded in December 2023, with the announcement of the LIFE 360 Business Partners plan. In addition, the Group also actively participates in sector initiatives for high-risk supply chains, such as the Colored Gemstones Working Group and Diamond Source Warranty Protocol and the Action for Sustainable Derivatives.

A PURCHASING PROCESS BASED ON THREE COMPLEMENTARY STAGES
With its Convergence program, LVMH aims to maintain tight control over its non-financial risks linked to its suppliers. It is based on a global map prepared in conjunction with Verisk Maplecroft. Suppliers are rated according to how critical they are. Those classified in the high-risk category on account of being mission-critical are assessed using the EcoVadis platform. The program also includes on-site audits.

Under this extensive analytical process with its three complementary stages, action plans are implemented with remedial measures when compliance breaches are identified. The goal is to support suppliers so they can make progress by adopting an approach aligned with their specific operational requirements.

To guarantee a harmonized approach Group-wide, the Maisons apply standardized audit frameworks. Certain Maisons also solicit anonymous or confidential feedback on working conditions from their suppliers’ employees so they can detect any breaches of employees’ fundamental rights.

To learn more, please refer to the Social and Environmental Responsibility Report:
Social and Environmental Responsibility Report

“In 2023, LVMH launched its LIFE 360 Business Partners program. It had one simple goal: involve our suppliers and our partners more closely in achieving LIFE 360’s ambitious environmental commitments. It’s a top priority because our Scope 3 accounts for 96% of our carbon footprint. Since it depends on our upstream and downstream value chains, it’s much harder to control. That’s why we can’t go it alone. LIFE 360 Business Partners will enable the Group and its suppliers to adopt a more sophisticated approach to sustainability. Program initiatives will be formulated and assembled gradually, in tandem with the Environmental Development Department."
MOHAMED MARFOUK,
LVMH’S OPERATIONS DIRECTOR
IMPROVING PRACTICES THROUGHOUT
OUR ECOSYSTEM
LIFE 360 BUSINESS PARTNERS
The Group launched LIFE 360 Business Partners to address the importance of cooperating with its ecosystem to reduce carbon emissions. The program, which is based on the existing transition plans of certain Maisons, will develop according to the needs expressed by suppliers during the Sustainability Business Partners Days starting in 2024. Work groups will promote communication and the sharing of knowledge, training approaches, and regulatory oversight to over time create a platform for sharing solutions and expertise.
CONTINUING TRAINING OUR EMPLOYEES IN RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING
The Group has introduced training in responsible purchasing designed in conjunction with Des Enjeux et des Hommes. The rationale for this is to fully involve everyone directly monitoring the strategic supply chains in achieving LVMH’s ethical, social and environmental targets. Since 2022, nine in-person training sessions have been held in Europe, North America, and Asia.
GUIDING STRATEGIC SUPPLIERS IN THEIR DRIVE TO UPSKILL
LVMH has introduced a special training framework for its strategic suppliers. In 2023, training sessions focused on the specific needs of certain countries were held again – for the fifth year in a row in China and for the third time in Italy. The Maisons also arrange modules specially geared to the operational challenges they encounter with their supply chains. Tiffany & Co., for example, ran training sessions during fall 2023 in Jaipur and Surat for its diamond and gemstone suppliers in India.

In 1994, photographer Jacques Lange captured an image of Ray Charles sat on the Great Salt Lake in northern Utah, USA, where the singer was shooting a commercial for the Peugeot 306 convertible.

The iconic photo became renowned around the world and prints are frequently sold at auction.
INSPIRATION
Before the magazine goes to press, final choices must be made between dozens and sometimes hundreds of photos. On October 10, 1963, Roger Thérond (center) and his team finalized issue No. 758 of the magazine, an homage to Edith Piaf, who had passed away that same day.

Finalizing issue No. 758
PARIS MATCH, ALWAYS THERE WHEN HISTORY IS BEING WRITTEN 
Paris Match has since its creation been a direct witness when the world falls apart before rebuilding itself, capturing fateful moments when chaos reigns. Born in the aftermath of the Second World War, Paris Match has since its founding focused its lens on armed conflicts across the globe. From the rice paddies of Indochina to the trenches in Ukraine, from the ruins of the World Trade Center on the evening of the September 11 terrorist attacks, to the stories of Afghan women being starved, repressed and deprived of education by the Taliban. On the front lines of battles and barricades, successive generations of photojournalists and reporters have risked their lives to share firsthand accounts of the somber face of humanity and help enlighten our thinking.

Four centuries ago in India, emperor Shah Jahan fell hopelessly in love with princess Mumtaz Mahal. He created the gardens of Shalimar in her honor, before dedicating the Taj Mahal to her. This incredible story fired the imagination of Jacques Guerlain, who created in 1925 the first oriental fragrance in history, sealed in its luxurious Baccarat crystal bottle: Shalimar.
EXCEPTIONAL SAVOIR-FAIRE
& MADE IN FRANCE
Made in France since 1828, Beauty by Guerlain is a meeting of tradition and innovation.
Guerlain has made its products in France in its own factories for nearly two centuries. From perfumers and the “Dames de Table” who decorate exquisite fragrance bottles, to artisans who make Météorites, Guerlain cultivates exceptional craftsmanship, preserving the rare, precious and unique skills behind mythic creations. This tradition continues today at the House’s production facilities in France, earning Guerlain recognition as a “Living Heritage Company” in 2005 for its exceptional savoir-faire.

The Emilio Pucci creations combine pure lines with the joy of color. He favored fluid, elastic materials such as the Emilioform jersey, which allow total freedom of movement and use. The Marilyn dress, loved by the actress and an international success, was designed for the sophisticated woman always on the go. One just had to roll it up and pack: in its happy ease, it was the contemporary spirit made dress, for globetrotters in constant travel. The idea of the first leggings, the palazzo pajamas and the caftans, and the foulard shirts was equally innovative in its dynamism.

Identity
BELVEDERE
Produced in one of the world’s longest operating polish distilleries, which has been making vodka since 1910, Belvedere’s Master Rye Distillers draw from a 600-year polish vodka-making history to artfully craft Polska rye into extraordinary spirits of distinct taste and character.
Small and intimate, the Polmos Żyrardów distillery delivers Belvedere’s signature consistent quality and has been recognized by the European Commission for its aggressive sustainability agenda, having reduced energy-related CO2 emissions by 42% since 2012.
Belvedere’s production is regulated by the Polska Vodka legal regulation, one of the strictest in the world. As the appellation dictates, all production must take place on Polish soil, the spirit must be made of either grain or potato, and nothing else can be added.

ICON
Belvedere is created by a collective - a family of employees who distill Belvedere in its hometown of Zyrardów in Poland. Belvedere only sources its Polska rye locally, working closely with eight agricultural partners allowing 100% traceability of the grains. It also started the Raw Spirit Program, launched in partnership with the Technical University of Lodz, to promote the sustainable growth of Polska rye.
INNOVATION
As the vodka category has become more associated with neutrality, Belvedere is proud to challenge the status quo. Belvedere believes that rye, the heart of our brand, delivers a vodka with both distinctive taste and character. Belvedere is Made With Nature –  Polska rye & purified water, distilled by fire.
Demonstrating this belief, Belvedere’s Master Rye Distillers have revived the tradition of malting to create Belvedere Heritage 176. With a process that includes steeping, sprouting, and heating Polska rye in kilns up to 176 degrees Fahrenheit, they have unlocked the hidden depths of rye for a true taste of vodka’s past.
The Belvedere Single Estate Rye series clearly illustrates the distinct effect that terroir has on the taste of the Dankowskie Diamond rye, when planted in the soil of two different regions of Poland – the lakeside Bartężek and forested Smogóry. When tasted side by side, the two estate vodkas deliver demonstrably different taste profiles. This proves that climate variation affects the taste of Polska rye and the pioneering notion that terroir exists in vodka.

Identity
SIRDAVIS
A first-of-its-kind joint venture, SirDavis reflects a shared vision between Moët Hennessy and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter around the future of American whisky. With a distinctive taste profile that delights both seasoned whisky connoisseurs and new enthusiasts, SirDavis is on a mission to redefine the category and invite new consumers to feel welcome to participate in the world of luxury whisky.

Crafted with Moet Hennessy's own five-time International Whisky Competition Master Distiller of the Year Dr. Bill Lumsden, SirDavis offers a one-of-a-kind taste profile that redefines the taste of American whisky with inspiration from Japanese and Scottish styles. The spirit's secondary maturation in sherry casks resulted in its silky, sophisticated profile with layers of dark red fruits and spices like clove and cinnamon. SirDavis is finished, blended and bottled in Knowles-Carter’s home state of Texas. 
I’ve always been drawn to the power and confidence I feel when drinking quality whisky and wanted to invite more people to experience that feeling. […] In partnering with Moët Hennessy, we have crafted a delicious American whisky that respects tradition but also empowers people to experience something new and unique in the category. You can taste it better than I could ever tell you — welcome, SirDavis.

A tall, eye-catching bottle with minimalistic, intentional design elements that serves as an emblem of power and an unmistakable beacon of luxury. 
This medallion showcases a bronzed horse in profile, referencing Knowles-Carter’s Texas roots and symbolizing both strength and respect.
INSPIRATION
Whisky has been Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s drink of choice for years, attracted not only by its sophisticated taste, but also by the inherent sense of strength and confidence it inspires.
After years of research and blind tastings, Knowles-Carter and Lumsden finally came up with the perfect liquid profile that delights both seasoned whisky connoisseurs as well as newer category enthusiasts.
Knowles-Carter came to uncover that her paternal great-grandfather, Davis Hogue, had been a successful moonshiner in the American South during Prohibition and would stash his bottles in the empty knots of cedar trees on his farm for friends and kin to find and enjoy. She quickly understood why her own love for whisky ran so deep. Four generations from when Davis Hogue made whisky on his land, his legacy is honored.
AROMA
Tangy Seville oranges mingle with soft sun-kissed raisins, while the sizzling spices of clove, cinnamon, and ginger play with luxurious notes of Demerara sugar and toffee.
TASTE
Rich & buttery toffee is followed by an array of spices with cinnamon, clove, and classic rye spice up front. Followed by soft, malty and biscuity notes intertwined with a vibrant citrus top note.
FINISH
Hints of honey are encountered with a soft, lingering finish reminiscent of plump sultanas and ripe cherries.

Cheval Blanc is based on four core values, the sum of which is unique in the world of hospitality. Craftsmanship, with a sense of detail pushed to extremes and painstaking groundwork on the product itself. Exclusive privacy, because the number of rooms is purposefully kept to a minimum. Creativity, which means that traditional codes are reinterpreted with boldness and modernity.  And finally, theArt de Recevoir and its thoughtful approach to service, which gives a unique character to each stay.

In 2021, Cheval Blanc unveils a new haven in the heart of the City of Light.
Conceived by Peter Marino and inspired by a bold, contemporary spirit, Cheval Blanc Paris pays tribute to Art Déco heritage and French savoir-faire and craftsmanship.
With only 72 rooms and suites, Cheval Blanc Paris is a confidential haven where guests wake up overlooking the Seine.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Culinary experiences, exclusive events, signature fragrances and à la carte Cheval Blanc Spa treatments make them a subtle showcase of the LVMH Group’s savoir-faire. This is our way of creating the special alchemy that happens when you combine a magical destination, local character, and the experience of hospitality at its purest. The entire team is trained in the art of French hospitality and is devoted to satisfying the most demanding requests. They look after them with efficiency and respect; their attention to detail is faultless. They also share the same determination to express originality, elegance or humor in their approach to service, giving the Maisons the feel of a home away from home and making guests want to return or perhaps experience one of Cheval Blanc’s other destinations…

The Puzzle represents the most refined expression of Newton Vineyard wines. Produced exclusively with grapes sourced from Newton Vineyard vines in the prestigious Spring Mountain, Mount Veeder and Yountville appellations, this exceptional cru is the result of meticulous selection of fruit from the estate’s best parcels, mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, as well as Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec.
The Puzzle expresses Newton’s dedication to working in harmony with nature. The wine has excellent cellaring potential.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Located on the hillside, the estate features many terraces and has 48 hectares of vines which are planted at altitudes varying from 150 to 490 meters. This arrangement is ideal for obtaining a wine with complex fruity notes. Each parcel has a specific soil type, sun exposure and microclimate, which gives the wines a great variety of flavors and aromas. To get the very best from this diversity and preserve the character of each parcel, all the grapes are harvested by hand and vinified separately. This provides the wine maker with an exceptional palette from which the wines from Newton vineyards can be blended. Fermentation occurs naturally, with local yeasts, to protect the characteristics of the fruit and to contribute to the complexity of the finished blended wine.

RUINART
VISIT THE WEBSITE
CEO
Frédéric Dufour
Creation date
1729
Headquarters
4, rue des Crayères, 51100 Reims - France
Identity
RUINART
The House of Ruinart was founded on September 1, 1729 by Nicolas Ruinart. His uncle, a learned Benedictine monk called Dom Thierry Ruinart had incredible insight. He foretold that this new “wine with bubbles”, developed in his native region of Champagne and which the royal courts of Europe adored, was destined for a bright future.
The creation of the House of Ruinart coincided with the dawn of the Enlightenment in France and of the French “art de vivre”. There arose in France a true culture of everything good and beautiful, favoring fine and elegant, light and sophisticated, delicate and rare taste. The cuvées naturally found their place.
Driven by a constant quest for excellence and the absolute, the House selected chardonnay, a rare and fragile grape variety, as the common thread for all its cuvées.
The House of Ruinart laid the first foundation stone of the history of champagne. Elegance, refinement, purity, light and its emblematic grape variety of chardonnay form its DNA and make it a true timeless and modern icon. It draws the power of its creations from three centuries of history. The balance between its origins and its bold promises is the key to its success and makes it a House that is perpetually contemporary.

ICON
Ruinart's Blanc de Blancs is the perfect expression of Ruinart style. Made using only chardonnay grapes, it is a blend of its best base wines, giving it aromatic richness, freshness and an exceptional purity. Timeless quintessence of the Ruinart taste, this cuvée is the greatest expression of such rare refinement.
ARCHITECTURE
The House of Ruinart’s chalk mines are like underground cathedrals of chalk that were first exploited during the Gallo-Roman period. These grandiose cellars were classified as a historical monument in 1931. They were dug by hand – the deepest measuring 38 meters in height beneath the vault – and their numerous tunnels criss-cross over a length of more than eight kilometers. Luminous white, these chalk mines spread over three levels offer a total absence of vibrations and a constant temperature and hygrometry: the ideal conditions for the fermentation and maturation of Ruinart cuvées. Over time, they have been the historic and privileged witnesses of the House’s greatest moments.
A major site in Champagne due to their majesty, grandeur and scale, the chalk mines are spread over 8 km and 3 levels

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Since its founding in 1729, the world’s first champagne house has crafted its exceptional wines by nurturing the roots of the terroir and ancestral savoir-faire. As Ruinart prepares for its fourth century, the Maison is deepening its commitment to preserving the soils that are a source of life, and to passing on time-honored savoir-faire and culture.
Sustainable development is not only imperative, for Maison Ruinart it is a source of innovation and creative inspiration.
Ruinart has taken sustainable packaging to a new level with a pioneering eco-design for 100% paper packaging that is fully recyclable and molded to fit the emblematic curves of the bottle.

ICON
Whispering angel is today’s worldwide reference for provence rosé. Made from Grenache, Cinsault and Rolle (Vermentino) grapes, its pale color is pleasing to the eye and draws one in. The rewarding taste profile is full and lush while being bone dry with a smooth finish. A blend of the best free run juices and press juices, fermented and aged in stainless steel with temperature control.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Château d’Esclans’ Harvest takes place each September from sunrise to noon to avoid the heat of the day. During the Harvest, grapes, at their ripest, are selected, picked and carefully placed in small crates. Caves d’Esclans Whispering Angel and some of Rock Angel’s voluminous quantity of grapes are mechanically harvested at night time to avoid heat of the day as well.
Once the grapes arrive to the cellars, they are sorted manually and then go through optical eye sorting. All grapes which go into vinification are perfectly de-stemmed and resemble each of the correct physical characteristics dictated by the wine maker including shape, size, color and general condition. This is verified by an optical eye camera which is programmed to detect whether grapes correspond to the established criteria. Grapes which do not are rejected.
CELLARS
Fermentation methods differ between partial barrel fermentation for Château d’Esclans and 100% barrel fermentation for Les Clans and Garrus. Our temperature controlled Oak Barrel Fermentation contributes to the enveloping texture and elegance of our wines. Our Cellar Master and his team oversee the reception, fermentation, and aging process from start to finish. They ensure that the accumulated detail, which goes into our unique wine making practices, is executed with optimal precision and care.

GUILLAUME HENRY

In 2021, Patou introduced its first leather handbag, Le Patou Bag, crafted from upcycled leather and produced in a limited and numbered edition. A bag that comes in an array of colors and can be worn in three ways, as a purse, across the chest, or over the shoulder. Put two of these half-circle hand-bags together and voilà! – the iconic JP monogram is revealed. In the spirit of the Patou Way, Le Patou Bag is sourced entirely from surplus stock.
INSPIRATION
Jean Patou revolutionized fashion, liberating the female silhouette. The couturier designed dresses to be worn without a corset and invented sportswear before its time, choosing tennis champion Suzanne Lenglen as his first muse.
In the 1920s, he reduced skirt lengths, marketed a pleated skirt for city wear, and designed jersey ensembles with geometric patterns.
A truly visionary couturier, Jean Patou invented the monogram, slipping his initials onto jersey swimsuits, which were marked with the Maison’s easily recognizable "JP".

PATOU CARES
Chez Patou, we want to contribute to a development that is more sustainable, fair and desirable. Our approach is based on five main lines of action and progress that are already being articulated into concrete contributions, particularly to limit the environmental footprint of our activities and establish a unique relationship with our manufacturers, all with the aim of increasing our positive impact each year.

Identity
PARFUMS CHRISTIAN DIOR
Christian Dior described himself as a fashion and perfume designer. The House of Dior, founded in 1946, changed the face of ladies’ style forever when its New Look was unveiled in the halls of 30 Avenue Montaigne on February 12, 1947. The revolutionary look was accompanied by a fragrance, Miss Dior, the finishing touch designed to “leave a trail of desire in a woman’s wake”. This timeless perfume was the first fragrance created by a visionary brand which invented the concept of global beauty with its Rouge Dior and subsequent cosmetic lines.
The current-day trustees of this legendary expertise – Francis Kurkdjian, Perfume Creation Director, and Peter Philips, Creative and Image Director for Dior Makeup – are the heirs to Christian Dior’s perfectionism. Their creations are renowned the world over thanks to Rihanna, Natalie Portman, Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson, the muses who embody the Maison’s appeal. These iconic faces of our fragrances are joined by a constellation of equally attractive and influential muses for our Makeup and Beauty Care creations.
In creating Dior perfumes I strive to both celebrate a rich heritage and envision the future with the audacity that defines the Maison. I pursue this creative quest with a passion shared by all the Maison’s teams. I want to continually push the limits of an olfactory luxury, conceived as an ultimate expression of Dior
FRANCIS KURKDJIAN
PERFUME CREATION DIRECTOR
It’s a great pleasure and honor to be part of the House of Dior. Being able to surprise our beauty loving audience with creativity and innovation is the most rewarding experience. Together with our excellent teams we keep on working daily towards a future filled with beauty.

ICON
An absolute classic in the world of fine perfumery, J’adore expresses all the sensual intensity and solar energy of a Dior woman. Its signature floral scent celebrates the expressiveness of Damask Rose and Tunisian Orange Blossom, enhanced by heady notes of Comoros Ylang-Ylang. J'adore embodies the couturier-perfumer’s dream of harmony.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Since it was founded, the House of Parfums Christian Dior has always demonstrated intense creativity combined with expert savoir-faire. As such, the area around Grasse, loved so dearly by Christian Dior, is still today more than ever a precious terroir for the composition of Dior fragrances. Benefiting from a unique geographical location, the cradle of flowers for perfumery produces truly exceptional blooms. Partnerships have been established in the area with devoted growers, whose May Rose and Grandiflorum Jasmine harvests are exclusively set aside for some of the House’s fragrances. Some of these include Les Extraits, whose olfactory beauty is also accompanied by rare glass-making craftsmanship. The savoir-faire of the Dames d’Atelier Dior is an invaluable treasure and includes dexterity and ancestral traditions such as the art of baudruchage which is handed down from generation to generation.

Through its music, voices and elegance, Radio Classique stands out from other stations by inviting its listeners to enjoy a well-deserved break to appreciate the beauty of its pieces.

News segments are also appreciated by its audience, as they also respect the values of the House: quality, time and discernment.

Identity
MOYNAT
Amongst all the wondrous characteristics of the Parisian leather goods Maison founded in Paris in 1849 lies this one extraordinary fact: its name belongs to Pauline Moynat, the first and only woman to bring feminine flair to the male-dominated metier of luxury trunk-making.
Historically, the Maison’s renaissance began parallel to the industrial boom with the invention of stylish travel trunks that redefined the art of traveling. From its 1873 English Trunk to the archetypal 1902 Limousine Trunk, which was customizable to cars’ bodies, Moynat’s close link to automobiles was only matched by the inspiration it drew from Belle Époque Paris and the creative world around it.
Two centuries later, Moynat continues its pioneering spirit. Through the mastery of traditional haute maroquinerie and innovative techniques, modern pieces are finished with exacting detail and uncompromising savoir-faire. Within this history lies a freedom of individuality to every Moynat creation.

THE OH! TOTE

Crafted from Canvas 1920 M monogram, this emblematic shape is adorned with new tri-coloured heritage ribbon - an artful detail that has been reimagined the archives. The leather trim handles are embellished with a round wheel-shaped detail, paying homage to the Maison's expertise in crafting bespoke automobile trunks.
THE GABRIELLE CLUTCH
Echoing the curved, sleek lines of Moynat’s historic Limousine Trunk, the Gabrielle Clutch bag is a discreet update to a signature shape of the Maison and a parallel of the city of Paris. Embellished with the distinct, M-shaped twist lock clasp and a removable strap for different ways of wearing.

The DANIEL ROTH Tourbillon is a milestone in Haute Horlogerie. Mr. Roth created the double-ellipse case by blending a square and circle to frame the Tourbillon to ensure readability. Inside, the DR001 calibre, developed by Master Watchmakers Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini, showcases remarkable craftsmanship and received the Tourbillon Watch Prize from the Grand Prix de l’Horolgerie de Genève.
INSPIRATION
Daniel Roth spent his youth mastering complex mechanical movements at Audemars Piguet and Breguet. His dedication to the Tourbillon earned Mr. Roth the first-ever Swiss chronometer certificate upon the brand’s launch. Aiming to revive horology's traditional craftsmanship, he focused on understated finishes and mechanical precision.
The brand follows Mr. Roth's original approach, relying on the finest watchmakers to create exceptional timepieces. In an age of rapid technological change, DANIEL ROTH watches remain timeless, crafted with traditional techniques that preserve the art of measuring time.

Few brands can boast such assets: with teams who are passionate about their Maison and the enduring appeal of iconic products. Plus of course there’s the unique style of founder Hubert de Givenchy, both timeless and avant-garde.  This subtle alchemy of audacity and heritage is the foundation of our brand.

Created by Hubert de Givenchy in 1957 as a tribute to Audrey Hepburn, L'Interdit reinvented itself in 2018. Each new olfactory variation is a forbidden blend both dark and bright, an invitation to transcend limits and elegantly embrace uniqueness. Rooney Mara, a captivating and engaged actress, embodies this powerfully unforgettable fragrance.
INNOVATION
Givenchy Parfums anticipates expectations, always exploring new territories for expression and constantly innovating. Prisme Libre is one of these stunning creations, born from a true mastery of light. Thanks to a unique loose powder formulation that mattifies and corrects with ultra precision, the four shades in each case complement one another to enhance the skin’s radiance.
This same philosophy is expressed in uniquely bold statements such as the highly-pigmented vibrant color of Le Rouge Interdit Intense Silk lipstick, both totally matte and exquisitely comfortable to wear thanks to its silky texture, or the hybrid  and marbled formulation of Le Rose Perfecto lip balm and the Crème Compacte Skin Perfecto. Development of new Givenchy Parfums packaging and formulations – such as the Le Soin Noir premium skincare line – is guided by the principles of  ecodesign.

THE MÉTIERS D'EXCELLENCE'S INITIATIVES
“EXCELLENT!” SESSIONS IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS
To ensure that our Métiers d’Excellence continue to thrive long into the future, LVMH created a program called “Excellent!” in January 2021 to present these exceptional professions to middle school and high school students, and recruit talents from young generations. Employees from LVMH and its Maisons visit schools to present skills and careers in Creative, Craft and Customer Experience métiers.The program has reached out to over 2,400 students to date.
“YOU AND ME”, THE MÉTIERS D’EXCELLENCE RECRUITING INITIATIVE
Each year, the Métiers d’Excellence LVMH organizes the “You and ME” tour, which visits cities across France from January to March to connect with future talents. Launched in 2022, this initiative reflects LVMH’s commitment to inclusion, seeking to develop the employability of young people and people seeking reskilling opportunities in creative, craft and customer experience professions, from retail to hospitality (hotels, restaurants and more). The events help guide people to targeted training programs and give them access to job opportunities. This traveling vocational and recruiting fair lets participants discover more than 280 skilled professions and apply for jobs (work/study contracts, internships, temporary and permanent job offers) available at LVMH Maisons throughout France.
THE INSTITUTE OF MÉTIERS D'EXCELLENCE

The identity of the Jardin d’Acclimatation is based on a collection of feelings, images, and places that every Parisian knew as a child and which now forms their collective  imagination. It is both a testimony to an unalterable world and a source of new enchantment, a heritage shared by every family, which is passed down from generation to generation, the symbol of a Paris that is both timeless and modern.

In 3 minutes, 400 meters of rotations and bends, peaking at up to 45km/hour, the five "Speed Rockets" shuttles, the park's flagship attraction, whizz visitors off on a unique roller-coaster ride between the pines and the sequoias. For thrill seekers!
MUSE
The Spanish-born Countess Eugénie de Montijo became Empress of France at the age of 27, and remained so until France’s defeat by Prussia in 1870. It was she who, along with the Emperor, created the Jardin d’Acclimatation. Guided by the great zoologist, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, the park’s first director and an ardent defender of the  observation of animals in their natural habitat, the young woman devoted herself to her scientific occupations. For example, she decided to develop the rearing of silkworms in France. To do this, she created one of the first silk farms in the very heart of the Jardin d’Acclimatation. It still exists and now houses an elegant café. A protector of the arts and literature, she, who appreciated Stendhal and Mérimée, also participated in the transformation of Paris at the height of the urban and industrial revolution.

Identity
MOËT & CHANDON
Since 1743 when it was founded, Moët & Chandon has been passing down unequaled winemaking savoir-faire and an innovative and pioneering spirit from generation to generation.
Claude Moët, its founder, was the first person to embody these values when he made his Champagne the most sought-after in Europe. With his grandson, Jean Remy Moët, a pioneering and visionary mind, Moët & Chandon became a major international champagne brand. This saga quickly transformed the family House into a worldwide symbol of success.
The 1,300 hectares of rich limestone soil, 50% of which is classed as Grand Cru and 25% Premier Cru, make up the largest vineyard area in Champagne. Underground, the Moët & Chandon cellars are the most extensive in the region. Extending more than 28 kilometers, they form a subterranean labyrinth where the wine metamorphoses under optimum conditions of humidity and temperature.

ICON
As the House's signature cuvée, Moët Impérial is its most comprehensive and universal expression. This Champagne is a perfectly executed blend of over 200 crus, mingling the full body of pinot noir with the suppleness of meunier and the finesse of chardonnay. The very incarnation of balance in Champagne for over 150 years.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
For Benoît Gouez, Cellar Master at Moët & Chandon since 2005, the champagne that he was previously ignorant of has now become a passion. In his own words: “I’m not from the wine world. I arrived here through a series of encounters, circumstances and above all, intuition! “. Benoît Gouez’s enthusiasm and expertise drove him to understand the spirit of Moët & Chandon Champagne, which he has been magnifying with boldness and elegance, vintage after vintage.
NATURA NOSTRA
“Nature has a land, Champagne. And a House: Moët et Chandon. For three centuries, their destinies have been inextricably linked. Actively engaged in an ecological transition for two decades, Moët et Chandon launched the Natura Nostra program in 2021 to take concrete action to support biodiversity beyond our estates. Much more than simply a large-scale agroecology program, Natura Nostra is a commitment to the future of the Champagne region, creating 100 kilometers of ecological corridors by 2027 and accelerating regenerative farming practices. Natura Nostra’s ambition is to cultivate vineyards responsibly, to diversify natural ecosystems, and to protect the flora and fauna of the Champagne region in order to pass on a healthy and sustainable natural heritage to future generations.”

Identity
MAISON FRANCIS KURKDJIAN
Maison Francis Kurkdjian was co-founded in 2009 by Francis Kurkdjian, a renowned perfumer with scores of successful creations to his name, and his long-time friend and business advisor Marc Chaya, a former partner in business advisory at Ernst & Young. The founding duo have applied their complementary talents to conceive a new territory of free expression in contemporary fragrances – sensual, generous and multi-facetted – where the perfume is naturally the hero.
The Maison is guided by precise codes: purity, sophistication, timelessness and the boldness of a reinvented classicism. Perfumer Francis Kurkdjian’s remarkable creative talent defines the unique personality of his eponymous house, where different facets of exceptional expertise come together and echo one another, providing the fundamentals on which Maison Francis Kurkdjian has been built, shaping its singular quality. With a focus on deliberate and sound international expansion, Maison Francis Kurkdjian is currently present in more than fifty countries.
Maison Francis Kurkdjian is committed to a long-term vision and to passing on unique savoir-faire. Since its creation, our teams and our partners have been united by meaningful values that anchor the  renown of the Maison. A deep respect for creativity, a love of the product and an unwavering focus on detail and quality have always guided our choices, enabling us to bring customers exalting experiences through fragrances.

ICON
Internationally-renowned perfumer Francis Kurkdjian has designed visionary fragrances that meld uncompromising quality and contemporary flair. For more than 20 years he has explored new creative territories in fragrances through his own bespoke fragrance atelier, collaborations with artists and pop-up installations.
ENGAGEMENT
Long-term projects supported by Maison Kurkdjian spring from sharing of savoir-faire and mutual sensibilities.
Conceived by Francis Kurkdjian and the gardeners of the Trianon estate at the Château de Versailles, the Perfumer’s Garden is the fruit of a mutual desire to share their respective knowledge and know-how with a broad public. Open since 2023, the Perfumer’s Garden enables visitors to discover hundreds of plants, their use in perfume-making and the rich history of perfumes in the court of Versailles.
Maison Francis Kurkdjian continues its active support for the living world by partnering the nonprofit Longitude 181, which works to protect sperm whales in the Mediterranean. The whales secrete ambergris, a natural material long used in crafting perfumes. Studies conducted by Longitude 181 enable a better understanding of how the sperm whales live in order to better protect them.
ARTISTIC CONVERSATIONS
The founding vision of Maison Francis Kurkdjian is inspired by creativity and its myriad expressions through unique artistic and cultural projects, bringing fragrance into unexpected realms.
In 2003, Francis Kurkdjian met artist Sophie Calle, who asked him to create “The Scent of Money”, his first fragrance installation. This marked the beginning of an ongoing aesthetic quest to erase the lines between disciplines and the five senses, leading to striking olfactory creations for some of the world’s most renowned cultural institutions.
Drawing on his passion for music, Francis Kurkdjian has recently  explored new experiences, composing scents whose notes resonate with concerts and operas, guided by the interpretation and emotion of the musicians. In March 2024, for the Cocteau/Philip Glass trilogy at the Cité de la Musique in Paris, he composed three fragrances that created a unique harmony with the performances by pianists Katia and Marielle Labèque in a thoughtful staging by Cyril Teste and Nina Chalot, all friends of the House.

ETHICS & COMPLIANCE
Every action taken by the Group and its employees reflects LVMH’s commitment to ethics and social and environmental responsibility. Committed to the highest standards in this area, the Group has defined rules of conduct and principles of action that guide the day-to-day behavior of its employees and all its stakeholders.
" At LVMH in our Maisons, we have long distinguished ourselves by making strong commitments to and taking care to comply with the highest standards of ethics and integrity, social responsibility, and respect for the environment, everywhere in the world. "
BERNARD ARNAULT
LVMH CODE OF CONDUCT
The Code of Conduct reflects the Group’s commitments to ethics and integrity, social and environmental responsibility. It refers to the charters and internal policies that have been developed on these topics: together, they form the ethics framework that governs all actions taken by LVMH and set out the rules that each employee must follow in their day-to-day activities.

The Code of Conduct is divided into three chapters:
a committed group
a responsible employer
a group with integrity

It is available in 25 languages.

> Access LVMH Code of Conduct 
SUPPLIER AND BUSINESS PARTNER CODE OF CONDUCT
LVMH attaches great importance to ensuring that its suppliers and business partners as well as their subcontractors share a set of common rules, practices and principles with respect to ethics, social responsibility and protection of the environment.
Each LVMH Group Maison therefore requires its suppliers and business partners to respect the principles detailed in the Supplier and Business Partner Code of Conduct and to ensure that their own suppliers and subcontractors do the same in the conduct of their activities for the Group.
> Access the Supplier and Business Partner Code of Conduct
THE LVMH ANTI-CORRUPTION CHARTER
The LVMH Anti-Corruption Charter reaffirms LVMH’s “zero tolerance” policy towards corruption and influence peddling. It sets forth a common set of rules on preventing corruption that apply to all Group employees. It gives concrete examples to illustrate the various types of conduct to avoid and provides guidance on the reflexes employees should develop.

> Access the Anti-Corruption Charter
THE RESPONSIBLE LOBBYING CHARTER
The LVMH Group takes part in public policy discussions in a spirit of constructive dialogue and cooperation with the stakeholders concerned, including but not only political leaders and the institutions responsible for decision-making. The key principles of integrity, transparency, and accuracy must guide the Group’s participation in the public sphere, which is in line with its ethical approach as set out in the LVMH Code of Conduct.

> Access the Responsible Lobbying Charter 
LVMH ALERT LINE
LVMH encourages open communication and dialogue within the Group and with its external partners and clients (“stakeholders”): that’s why the Group created the LVMH Alert Line, an online interface that provides a fully confidential and secure way of reporting in good faith violations of the laws, regulations, or principles of internal conduct.

Identity
FRED
A jeweler renowned for virtuoso savoir-faire and superb technical expertise, Maison FRED has for nearly 90 years embodied the personality and vision of founder Fred Samuel. Inspired by his warm outlook, always avid to engage with others, along with his love of light and irrepressible joie de vivre, Maison FRED has become known as the “Sunshine Jeweler”. This distinctive identity has given birth to jewels with signature character to celebrate life’s memorable moments, both big and small. Nourished by a rich design heritage informed by art, FRED is also inspired by the world of the French Riviera, much loved by Fred Samuel and his eponymous jewelry house.
Under the signature sunshine of FRED, jewels scintillate in a unique light. Their magnetic brilliance reflects subtly relaxed elegance, combined with the glamour of emotionally-charged design. The refinement of these exceptional pieces is often elevated by a bold twist thanks to their signature interchangeability.
With solar-infused creative audacity, FRED has for nearly 90 years embodied the essence of modern jewelry that becomes an integral part of living. The Sunshine Jeweler gives free rein to passion, making each instant more intense…and more precious.

ICON
The Force 10 collection has become an icon, embodying the passion for the sea shared by Fred Samuel and his family, along with the accompanying values of courage and pushing limits – the name itself derives from the highest winds and most turbulent waves on the scale – a symbol of an unquenchable thirst for freedom. This icon of modernity has enjoyed success that transcends time and fashion, winning the hearts of generations of women and men who stop at nothing, not even the limits of the horizon.
In 1966, a braided steel sailing cable with a gold buckle was a bold and innovative marriage of materials that might have seemed polar opposites. Yet this unexpected contrast gave birth to the Force 10 bracelet, and FRED launched a veritable revolution in jewelry. Creating the first unisex jewelry with a chic and sporty style, FRED further marked its singular ethos, bold, free and resolutely embracing modern elegance. Nearly 60 years since its creation, the Force 10 has made this alliance of materials a precious signature of timeless modernity and a source of infinite creativity.
FRED’s emblematic F10 collection can be worn in a thousand and one ways. The original creative audacity has been joined by versatile interchangeability, elevated by an energetic spectrum of buoyant and solar colors, inviting a mix & match with boundless possibilities.

Identity
MAKE UP FOR EVER
Since its inception in 1984, Make Up For Ever has been collaborating with professional makeup artists to stay at the cutting-edge of technological, formulistic and artistic advances, while offering everyone access to all products and benefits.
Education and transmission are at the core of the brand’s mission. Make Up For Ever is the only brand with a worldwide network of makeup schools from Paris to Shanghai: the Make Up For Ever Academies. 1300 students graduate each year, they are the bedrock of a unique and strong relationship with makeup artists. Merging talent, promoting artistry and sharing savoir-faire are at the heart of the brand.
Make Up For Ever is passionate about diversity and individuality encouraging everyone to bring out their singularity, claim it and have fun with it.
At Make Up For Ever, we are a team, we are your team and everyone is welcome.
Products are serious, but makeup remains a game. I wanted to create a universe of freedom by imagining infinite colors with high technology with simple products for an ultra-long-lasting result. I wanted makeup to become a source of inspiration, a real field of possibilities.

ICON
More than 10 years ago, the film and TV industry were revolutionized with the arrival of High Definition cameras and screens. MAKE UP FOR EVER then developed UHD, an iconic foundation designed for professionals.
In 2022, the brand pushes the boundaries of performance. UHD reinvents itself and becomes HD SKIN: the undetectable and true-to-skin foundation co-created by makeup artists.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Dany Sanz, former Fine Arts student, founded Make Up For Ever in 1984 to address the unmet needs of makeup artists. In the 80’s the makeup universe was lacking creativity with very few products available and a limited number of shades. Dany decided first to transpose the Fine Arts palette into a makeup palette. She started developing highly pigmented and high-performance formulas, coupled with tailor made tools and brushes. A true revolution in the world of makeup: a creative and innovative brand with products designed for everyone.
Dany Sanz has been teaching makeup techniques for the past 40 years and has inspired generations of makeup artists and onwards as an authentic pioneer. Her legacy lives on.

Identity
CHAUMET
In the heart of Place Vendôme in Paris, Chaumet crafts jewelry that melds audacity and elegance. Combining tradition and modernity, the artisans of Chaumet’s High Jewelry workshop pass on their exceptional know-how to create masterpieces of lightness and movement, including the Maison’s famed tiaras. Chaumet’s emblematic collections are inspired by the multi-faceted personality of  Empress Joséphine, the Maison’s first prestigious client, who designated Chaumet as her official jeweler. Since the founding of the Maison in 1780, Chaumet’s timeless style has continually evolved with the times and influences of the world for more than 240 years.
The first jeweler to set up shop on Place Vendôme in 1812, Chaumet has made this mythic nexus of Parisian jewelry its beating heart. Chaumet celebrated its 240th anniversary in 2020 with the inauguration of  its magnificently renovated address at 12, Place Vendôme. Bridging tradition and modernity, 12 Vendôme embodies the soul of Chaumet through three exceptional spaces: the boutique welcoming clients, the historic grand salons – notably the Salon Chopin – and the High Jewelry workshop, where dreams come alive….
At Chaumet, we are committed to sharing the values of excellence and passing on unique savoir-faire that have inspired us for over 240 years. We are proud of our exquisite craftsmanship – still practiced  at Place Vendôme, where Chaumet became the first jeweler to take up residence – as well as the distinctive Parisian elegance we have brought to prestigious customers over the ages. This rich heritage continues to inspire us as we innovate and move forward to offer our customers ever more contemporary and inclusive jewelry creations and explore exciting new possibilities and trends around the world.

ICON
Inspired by the multi-faceted personality of the Empress Joséphine, the Maison’s first grand client, each Chaumet collection evokes a distinctive part of her character.

With bold femininity, the Joséphine collection resonates with the Empress’s taste for fashion, proposing pieces with contemporary style, inspired by the tiara. The signature of the collection is pear cut gems, a favorite of Joséphine.

First introduced in 1977, the Liens collection offers jewelry rich in meaning, symbolizing the universal bonds that unite us. The collection is inspired by the love story between Joséphine and Napoleon, who commissioned Chaumet to craft his first ceremonial jewelry.

The emblematic motif of the Bee My Love collection is the graphic honeycomb, derived from the imperial bee. Refined to abstraction, these creations shine with mirror-polished gold set off by diamonds. The naturalist inspiration echoes the passion of the Empress for botanical wonders.
VIRTUOSITY
Combining exquisite craft and artistic inspiration, Chaumet has for 240 years nurtured a distinctive vision of creativity,  passed on over generations from one master jeweler at the head of the High Jewelry workshop to the next. Virtuosity extends beyond simple know-how, expressed through an ineffable grace infused with soul that makes Chaumet jewelry truly unique. In the High Jewelry workshop at 12 Vendôme, right from the sketch to the finished jewelry, jewelers, setters and polishers bring jewels to life. Time is the unifying element in the Chaumet equation. A single piece can take artisans nearly 2,000 hours of meticulous work.
Chaumet virtuosity is above all a human adventure, a story of shared talent and collective creation across the design studio, the workshop and expert sourcing of gemstones.
The art of drawing is central to the creation of each piece, accompanied by a variety of settings that celebrate the beauty of each gemstone and heighten its brilliance. Metal dissolves in a quest for lightness to magnify the stones thanks to the fil couteau technique. Chaumet elevates the art of color to its apogee, fusing emotion and excellence. Chaumet’s virtuosity allows technical prowess to disappear behind a sensation of miraculous lightness.

OUR MISSION
The world leader in luxury, LVMH is a family-led Group that has since its founding in 1987 deployed a business model anchored in fostering the development of its Maisons while respecting their distinctive identities. All LVMH Maisons craft products and services that strive for excellence and meet the highest ethical, social and environmental standards. They all champion the Group's mission, The Art of Crafting Dreams.
Over the centuries, all our Maisons have managed to both preserve and enhance their material and intellectual heritage, with a constant focus on the quality of their products and services. To ensure this excellence from top to bottom, the Group has mastered the vertical integration of its value chain, from the sourcing of the finest raw materials, through manufacturing, to selective distribution. It's this model that guarantees the excellence of our products over time. Products designed to stand the test of time, generation after generation.
While we have never compromised on the quality of our products that drives our economic success, we are equally uncompromising on the ethical, social and environmental responsibilities they entail. That's why, year after year, we step up our initiatives. At LVMH, we have always been strongly committed to acting with and promoting integrity in all our activities and relationships, whether that be with our employees, our partners or any other stakeholders. Today, this approach provides an answer to the question of the companies' ethical responsibility and the position a group such as LVMH should hold within society. It reflects our sense of duty as an industry leader.
OUR VALUES, KEYS TO EXCELLENCE
LVMH's long-term performance is based on four fundamental values defined by Bernard Arnault and shared by everyone in the Group.

Identity
BERLUTI
Berluti has been making shoes for the elegant man since it was founded. The Duke of Windsor, Jean Cocteau, Andy Warhol… The greatest clients walked through the House’s doors, each one passionate about and captivated by the timeless elegance of these exceptional shoes, elevated to the rank of works of art. Offbeat classicism and technical virtuosity are keynotes of the House, while its character remains the same. Its story began at the end of the 19th century, when a young 30-year-old Italian brought his creative energy to Paris in order to practice his craft as a master shoemaker. He named his first model, a lace-up shoe, after himself, Alessandro, and the House took his surname, Berluti. Since then, every generation of the House has cultivated exceptional savoir-faire in the mastery of form and working with leather and patinas. The result is models that are incomparably elegant and comfortable. But more than simply a prestigious shoemaker, Berluti has always represented a certain art de vivre. Naturally, new areas of expression have been explored: leather goods in 2005, and in 2011 a ready-to-wear line was launched.

ICON
In 1895, Alessandro Berluti designed a lace-up shoe made from a single piece of leather with no visible stitching. The purity of its lines was perfect. Available today in a variety of forms and an infinite range of patinas in different colors, the "Alessandro" shoe was born and the House of Berluti had its own signature style.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Hand-assembled and customizable from the wooden last to the choice of leather and patinas, Berluti bespoke shoes combine absolute comfort and unique flair. As opposed to ready-to-wear shoes, or “demi-mesure” shoes, which are simple adaptations of existing models, bespoke shoes are created from scratch. The client is at the very center of the process, and the future shoe will be created according to the morphology of his foot. From the meeting between the master shoemaker and the client to delivery, no less than 50 hours of work are required to create a pair of bespoke shoes. Shape, soles, colors… everything is adapted to the client’s desires, needs and specifications. This includes the choice of leather – from the emblematic Venezia leather to more exotic hides. Last-maker, pattern-maker, cutter, stitcher… the craftsmen in the bespoke workshops will have carried out over 250 operations in order to offer their client the perfect shoe.

CEO
Julien Morel
Creation date
1858
Headquarters
68-70, avenue de Champagne, 51200 Epernay - France
Identity
MERCIER
The young founder was just 20 years old when he established his own champagne house in Épernay. With a succession of technical accomplishments and bold publicity campaigns, he followed a non-conformist vision: to make his wine known and appreciated by everyone. To highlight his labors, Eugène Mercier took advantage of all opportunities available at the time, including: world fairs, the railways and cinema.
To get people talking about his champagne, in 1870 he decided to build the largest wine cask in the world! With a monumental gage of over 20 tonnes, measuring 5 meters in height and able to hold up to 200,000 bottles, the cask was one of the major attractions of the 1889 Exposition Universelle, a competition won by the Eiffel Tower. The reputation of Champagne Mercier soon spread beyond France. Non-conformist, in the spirit of the times, informal and spontaneous, the House offers a wine in its own image, enjoyed by gourmets for whom quality is synonymous with lightness and originality.
What still amazes me even today is the complexity and richness that blending delivers. I am surprised to see how each grape variety, chardonnay, pinot noir and meunier, reveals its qualities during the process. Our customers enjoy the easily perceivable and recognizable aromas of fruit, which create a fruity, bold, spontaneous and authentic champagne with a simple and recognizable taste.

Sought after by consumers looking for simplicity above all, Mercier’s indulgent yet fresh style is something all connoisseurs agree on. A trusty companion for times of true togetherness, Mercier Brut remains the very expression of Mercier champagnes' authenticity and elegance.
INNOVATION
To illustrate its positioning as an easy-going champagne for a target market of urban consumers, Mercier commissioned self-taught graphic designer and illustrator David Lanaspa. This inspiring encounter led to an inspired partnership. The illustrations used for the marketing campaign reflect the lifestyles of our time and reinterpret the House’s traditions in a contemporary spirit. A simple and elegant style for a champagne to be shared at home with friends in a convivial atmosphere.

Identity
CONNAISSANCE DES ARTS
When it first appeared in 1952, Connaissance des Arts was the first art magazine to combine both in-depth articles and color reproductions. More than 70 years on, the magazine continues to cover art created in the past and present with the same passion, drawing on contributions from leading journalists and experts.
The magazine’s editorial line is deliberately open, bringing readers insights into art in all its myriad forms, showcasing young talent and emerging trends alongside established artists. In addition to features on exhibitions, auctions, fairs and shows, Connaissance des Arts also publishes over 50 special issues each year which explore specific themes
Art lovers can also keep current with art news via the magazine’s website, an online extension of the print edition featuring additional photos and videos. Plus there is a superb Connaissance des Arts mobile app.
Connaissance des Arts: a passion for enjoying and learning about art
Through the magazine, special issues and digital iterations, Connaissance des Arts proposes a serious and curious take on every aspect of international art news. Connaissance des Arts follows major events initiated by the LVMH Group, reflecting a strong belief that passion and education are central to our editorial activities.

In both its print and digital formats, Connaissance des Arts covers everything from museums to art in our daily lives with a contemporary tone. The content embraces every aspect of art, including major temporary exhibitions. Exclusive reports feature visits to artist studios, prominent collectors, as well as museums. In-depth articles spark both conversations and curiosity among readers.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Eager to enhance understanding and promote culture, Connaissance des Arts’ journalists offer an exhaustive and enlightened analysis of French and international art news within their fields of expertise.
In the special issue collection, which offers a more didactic approach, themes are examined in depth and the most interesting exhibitions are analyzed and reviewed by our best experts.
CONNAISSANCE DES ARTS SUPPORTS THE APPLIED ARTS
The practice of many centuries-old applied arts is becoming increasingly rare. Connaissance des Arts has for a decade actively promoted these often little-known métiers at the crossroads of meticulous craftwork and art, applied arts and artistic creation in its different media, including special issues on Métiers d’Art, vertical navigation links on the website, newsletters and more. It is more essential than ever that skilled craftspeople be recognized as full-fledged creative talents and enjoy access to resources to pass on and preserve these unique skills and know-how.

Identity
ACQUA DI PARMA
Acqua di Parma, the epitome of Italian sophistication, continues a century-long legacy, intertwining traditional craftsmanship with modern artistry. Incepted by Colonia, the Maison’s hallmark fragrance, through the vision of baron Carlo Magnani, Acqua di Parma is the essence of an attitude that embodies a dynamic, modern, and original lifestyle. Made for the personal use of the baron and a small circle of loved ones, the original composition is an open invitation to those seeking a modern Arte di Vivere, a life of vibrance and luminescence.
GUILIO BERGAMASCHI
Giulio Bergamaschi joined the LVMH Group in April 2022 as Strategic Missions Director of Maison Loro Piana, where he focused on Brand Strategy and textile Excellences valorization through enhanced client experience and transparency initiatives, like the traceability digital certification with Aura Blockchain Consortium.
In March 2023 he has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Maison Acqua di Parma.
Giulio defines himself as Italian and cosmopolitan, passionate about design and art.

Vibrant and timeless, Colonia remains the hallmark of Acqua di Parma since its inception in 1916. Created by the visionary baron Carlo Magnani, Colonia is the essence of an attitude that embodies a dynamic, modern, and original lifestyle. Made for the personal use of the baron and a small circle of loved ones, the composition has remained the same ever since.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Each fragrance and object produced by Acqua di Parma exemplifies the Maison's philosophy that cherishes the human touch and the distinctive flair of experienced craftsmen. Handmade excellence shines where the art is in the details, from the selection of materials to the finishing touch of an engraved bottle. Exceptional contemporary artisans with techniques of long-held traditions, skills honed over the years, and deep-seated knowledge craft polysensorial objects that stand the test of time.
From the Maison's iconic hat box to its emblematic cube candles, these vibrant creations are marked by the finest processes, whether a precise brush stroke or a gentle fold. Intertwining traditional craftsmanship with modern style, this artisanal legacy now extends into the Leather Objects collection, an ode to virtuoso Italian craftsmanship, transforming everyday moments into extraordinary experiences.

2,000 years ago in ancient Rome, the renowned physician Claudius Galenus was known to treat gladiator wounds with his salves. Over 20 years ago, fresh co-founder Lev Glazman discovered a recipe of Galenus’ credited to be the world's first cream, which became his muse for Crème Ancienne. Inspired by the original recipe's ratio of oils and waxes, fresh's iconic cream is handmade in small batches in a monastery.

Our vineyards have resisted the extreme climate conditions in Toro as well as the phylloxera attack for years. These vineyards symbolize the unique Bodega Numanthia heritage, very old vines dating back over a hundred years. We hope to preserve these ancient vines and their expression, which combines both the structural power and elegance ofterroirthat can be found in our wines.

Termanthia is the ultimate expression of the best vineyard in the Toro Designation: Teso de los Carriles. From hand de-stemming to foot-crushing, creating wine with these unique grapes involves hand-crafting excellence and meticulous know-how. The sublime fruit concentration unveils a magnificent aromatic complexity and reveals incredible intensity and elegance.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Bodega Numanthia estate covers 83 hectares.  On these sunny parcels, the vineyards are planted far away from one another, not aligned in perfect rows. In order to survive the dry climate, the vines need plenty of space so that their roots can spread out deep into the soil. But Bodega Numanthia vines are unique not only in terms of their layout, but also by their age: 40% are over 70 years old, and the extraordinary 4.8-hectare parcel of Teso de los Carriles includes a handful of vine stocks that are over 140 years old. The art of oenology entails extracting the very best from these incredible vines, particularly the intense fruit aromas that are so specific to the Tinta de Toro grape, while shaping the elegance and structure of this appellation. While this approach to winemaking is shared by all three wines produced at the estate, each of them (Termes, Numanthia and Termanthia) has its own style and profile, sometimes vibrant and fruity, sometimes intense and powerful but always elegant and sophisticated.

ARCHITECTURE
A hidden treasure can be found at the boundary of this age-old estate: a 16th-century church, built by Rodrigo Gil de Hontañon, architect to the Catholic Monarchs. The building is at the top of the village of Valdefinjas, and had been in ruins since the 1970s. A renovation project was financed by the estate in order to restore this architectural gem. Work was carried out on the walls, the structure and the roof, to prevent it from collapsing completely. In seven months, the church’s exterior was returned practically to its original state. The inside houses some wonderful treasures including the sacristy floor from the 13thcentury, and a magnificent cupola carved into the stone. This outstanding discovery, revealed to local residents during an organized tour, has energized the village and offered the estate a priceless historical treasure.

The first release from Armand de Brignac, the Brut Gold remains the most iconic cuvée in the range. Rich with the old-world traditions of champagne blending, it is a trio of vintages from some of the most lauded terroirs in the region, resulting in a prestige cuvée with vibrant fresh fruit character, and layers of complexity.

Creation date

Headquarters

Identity
GIVENCHY
New elegance with a modern twist and femininity combine in the timeless world of Givenchy. Its style is the signature of Hubert de Givenchy, who established the eponymous Haute Couture Maison at the start of the 1950s. Combining finesse, discretion, and elegance, he ensured his designs and ateliers rose to the top and played a key role in international fashion. In 1957, an expansion of scope took place with the launch of the Maison's first fragrance, L’Interdit – a symbol of the legendary friendship between Hubert de Givenchy and Audrey Hepburn. Ever since then iconic creations from the Maison have continued to cultivate elegance and boldness.
In September 2024, Givenchy opened a new chapter in the history of the Maison announcing Sarah Burton as Creative Director of both the womenswear and menswear collections.

AVENUE GEORGE V IN PARIS WHERE HUBERT DE GIVENCHY ESTABLISHED HIS FASHION HOUSE
ICON
Hubert de Givenchy was an ambitious visionary and was just 24 years old when he founded his Maison. He was able to predict the casual chic and democratization of luxury that would leave its mark on the 20th century and launched his 'séparables' - elegant blouses paired with light skirts. This was the start of his success.

Identity
FENTY BEAUTY BY RIHANNA
Rihanna created Fenty Beauty “so that women everywhere would be included,” focusing on a wide range of traditionally hard-to-match skin tones, developing formulas that work for all skin types, and pinpointing universal shades. Her vision, above all, is to inspire: “Makeup is there for you to have fun with. It should never feel like pressure. It should never feel like a uniform. Feel free to take chances, and take risks, and dare to do something new or different.”
Fenty Beauty by Rihanna was created for everyone: for women of all shades, personalities, attitudes, cultures, and races. I wanted everyone to feel included. That’s the real reason I made this line.

Each artistic commission creates a unique reimagining of a Belmond property and has led to a series of photobooks by world renowned artists. In 2024, the brand launched the Belmond Photographic Residency to foster the next generation of talent. The jury for this award is made up of leading figures in international photography and champions unpresented talent from around the world.

Identity
BVLGARI
Bvlgari was founded in the heart of Rome in 1884. Over the decades, the Brand has established a worldwide reputation as magnificent Roman High Jeweler and icon of Italian art of living. 
Through a pioneering vision, the company’s international success has evolved into a global and diversified luxury purveyor of products and services, ranging from fine jewels and high-end watches to accessories and perfumes, and featuring an extended network of boutiques and hotels.
Demonstrated through its numerous philanthropic partnerships, Bvlgari deeply believes in innovating the present for a sustainable future through its commitment to Social & Environmental Responsibility and giving back – to nature and to the community. In 2024 the Maison announced the creation of Fondazione Bvlgari, reinforcing its devotion to building a meaningful tomorrow through care, generosity and long-term dedication.
Rome has shaped the art and architecture of the Western world for 27 centuries and Rome is the birthplace of Bvlgari, which through its creations reflects the shapes, colors, magnificence and timelessness of the Eternal City. Always pioneering and contemporary, Bvlgari has gradually become the jeweler of time, precious accessories, olfactory emotions and hospitality to create the most desirable luxury experience of our time. This is the mentality that has guided Bvlgari for the last 140 years and the vision for the future.

Identity
GLENMORANGIE
Glenmorangie single malt whisky has been produced in the Scottish Highlands since 1843, when farmer William Matheson and his wife Anne followed their dreams and founded the Glenmorangie Distillery. Considered a pioneer in its field, the Scottish Distillery has become famous for combining tradition and innovation to create the most delicious whiskies. To achieve this, Glenmorangie single malt whisky is created by the people of Tain with a unique distillation process that uses the tallest stills in Scotland. Expertly matured in only the finest oak casks, the resulting single malt is testament to the savoir-faire that has been passed down from generation to generation by a team of expert craftsmen and women.
Though a bio-chemist by training, I believe it takes both art and science to craft the finest whiskies and I regularly travel the world seeking inspiration for future expressions of Glenmorangie. I am passionate about all areas of whisky making, but especially the importance of wood management, sourcing casks from intriguing vineyards around the world to complement the extra maturation of Glenmorangie which bring new and unique characteristics all of their own.

ICON
First released more than 175 years ago by our founders, the original Glenmorangie 10 year old was known for its mellow tones and delicacy of flavour.
All these years later, The Original remains at the heart of everything we do. Like home, we carry with us, no matter how far we travel. And every time we return, we discover something new.
To give Original a delicious, go-anywhere finesse, we make it in our giraffe-high stills, then we age it 10 years in bourbon casks to absorb all manner of delectable flavours.
The result is a smooth whisky which welcomes you with a rush of citrus, then holds your attention with layers of luscious flavour, from orange to honey and creamy vanilla, with bursts of peach.
We are constantly embarking on new sensory journeys, yet we always come home to Original.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
The Glenmorangie Distillery’s expertise has developed over the last 175 years, passed down by each generation with unwavering commitment to excellence and the development of innovative techniques in whisky making and maturation. With perfection always in mind, the House uses mineral-rich Tarlogie Spring water and carefully chosen Scottish barley in its production.  Glenmorangie is distilled in Scotland’s tallest stills, with copper necks that are 5.14 metres high, so that only the lightest and purest vapors are captured for maturation, producing a smooth, elegant, delicious single malt whisky.

BENEFIT COSMETICS
Benefit Cosmetics was founded in 1976 by twins Jean & Jane Ford in San Francisco in a quest to shake up the status quo and redefine beauty as whatever makes you feel good. 

Since then, Benefit has served up innovative, uncomplicated beauty products & services...always with a fun, creative twist. Our iconic product packaging, whimsical names, and the irreverent spirit behind everything we do are an invitation to embrace the joy in beauty. 
As the first brand to bring brow waxing out of the backroom and into the window of our boutiques, we made brows our obsession and eventually became the #1 brow brand worldwide*.  

The relentlessly innovative, never-say-never spirit of our founders is why today, Benefit has reached prestige powerhouse status, operating in 50+ countries with 3,200+ locations worldwide and growing. So, whether you want a beauty solution you can trust or just need a good laugh, Benefit has your brows AND your back.   

*Based on estimated total global prestige brow product retail sales January – December 2023 
Benefit has stood out in a crowded beauty landscape by staying true to our unique DNA, making our own rules, and having plenty of fun along the way. Fueled by our relentlessly innovative, let’s-make-it-happen culture, we are on a mission to make beauty radically feel-good with inventive solutions that inspire the fun-loving, fearless individual in all of us.

Identity
DOMAINE DES LAMBRAYS
Property deeds in the archives of the Abbaye de Citeaux dating back to 1365 refer to an estate called “Cloux des Lambrey” in Morey-St-Denis. Divided among 74 owners during the French revolution, the vineyard – which covers 8.70 hectares (about 21.5 acres) in the heart of the Côte des Nuits – was not reunified until the late 19th century.
In 1938, Renée Cosson inherited the Domaine du Clos des Lambrays and little was done for upkeep of the vineyard until 1979, when it was purchased by Roland de Chambure and the Saier brothers. Working with winemaker Thierry Brouin, they restored the estate and its wine to its former glory, and in 1981 Domaine des Lambrays was awarded Grand Cru status.
The Domaine has consistently produced superb wines over the years, earning it the sobriquet “jewel of the Côte de Nuits”.

ICON
One of five Grands Crus in Morey St Denis, Clos des Lambrays wines have a complex personality, at the same time full-bodied, unpolished and supple. Aptly described as “an iron fist in a velvet glove”, this exceptionally elegant Grand Cru is characterized by notes of black fruit. It is listed among the world’s 100 best wines in numerous reference sources.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Situated on a narrow strip of land where vines have grown since the time of Charlemagne and the Dukes of Burgundy, Domaine des Lambrays covers nearly 9 hectares (around 22 acres). The clay and limestone soil of the Côte de Nuits produces a pinot noir wine considered among the best in the world.
The Domaine produces a wine crafted in the purest tradition of Burgundy winemaking. With careful sorting of grapes during the harvest and rigorous selection of cuvées, Domaine des Lambrays applies its savoir-faire with a single-minded commitment to excellence.

OUR ASCENSION JOURNEY
Like mountaineers aiming for the summit, Terrazas de los Andes team embarked on an asension journey, discovering lands that would contribute the freshness and elegance to crafting fine mountain wines. They first discovered Las Compuertas, a malbec vineyard of ungrafted vines, planted in 1929 at 1070 m. In the years that followed, they rediscovered the Uco Valley, acquiring Los Castaños vineyard, in Paraje Altamira, planted at 1100 m, followed by Licán, planted in Los Chacayes at 1200 m; and finally, reaching to El Espinillo, in Gualtallary, cultivated at 1650m becoming the highest productive vineyard in the Uco Valley, thus completing this mosaic of high-altitude plots.
Terrazas de los Andes team embarked on an asension journey, discovering lands that would contribute the freshness and elegance to crafting fine mountain wines
WINEMAKING HERITAGE
The winery, witness to 20th-century winemaking, shares a strong connection with the values of Terrazas de los Andes. Preserving and sharing its cultural, historical, and architectural significance is part of our commitment to the community.
“We maintain and enhance its structural integrity, combining past and future, history and technology. We celebrate its culture, and perpetuate its story through our malbecs, worldwide.” Lucas Löwi
GUARDIANS OF MOUNTAIN LIFE
At Terrazas de los Andes, we maintain a special connection with the mountains and their fragile ecosystem. The altitude with its cool mountain climate contributes to the elegance of our wines, the pure meltwater nourishes our vines, the diverse alluvial soils define the character of our grapes, and the native flora and fauna leave a special imprint on our wines. That's why we are committed to being guardians of mountain life.

"Innovation means creating the classics of tomorrow."
Created by Maurice Hennessy in 1870, X.O is the perfect illustration of this maxim, which is dear to heart of the cognac House. Two years only after its creation, X.O allowed Hennessy to strengthen its presence in China. It gave the world a radically new approach to aging eaux-de-vie.
INSPIRATION
In 1765, Richard Hennessy founded the House that bears his name. An Irish officer living in exile in France, he left his native land to pursue a unique destiny, showing resilience in the face of adversity. He introduced the art of selecting and ageing eaux-de-vie to cognac, always with an unwavering insistence on quality.
Richard Hennessy and his son James established what would become the standard in the cognac industry. 
A committed humanist, his openness towards other cultures and his sense of excellence continue to inspire the House today.
ENGAGEMENT
From Cognac to the entire world, we work together to cultivate the future and become the benchmark for exemplary sustainability in luxury wines and spirits.
We preserve and enrich our natural ecosystems, practicing agro-ecology, reforestation and reducing our carbon footprint and water consumption.
We are committed to fostering progress for both the communities close to our heart – our employees, our partners and cognac artisans – as well as communities the world over. We do this with an emphasis on inclusion, diversity and support for the development of these communities.

A brand that makes the world more beautiful, a brand that celebrates nature and expresses a passion for flowers, joyfulness, poetry and dreams. A Maison infused with the spirit of designer Kenzo Takada and unique Japanese roots, whose contagious spirit of freedom and celebration of cultural diversity resonate powerfully with today’s young generations.

THE POWER OF A FLOWER TO MAKE THE WORLD MORE BEAUTIFUL.
Since the poppy has no scent, KENZO invented the fragrance of this fragile but strong flower. Master perfumer Alberto Morillas imagined this unique scent, a powdery floral, unexpected and poetic.

Identity
BARTON PERREIRA
Founded in 2007 by Bill Barton and Patty Perreira in Southern California, Barton Perreira draws inspiration from the perpetual sunshine and enchanting golden-hour sunsets that paint the state in gold.
Barton Perreira embodies a fusion of innovation, craftsmanship, and a resolute commitment to pushing the boundaries of eyewear excellence.
In 2023, Barton Perreira entered LVMH, after the acquisition by Thélios, the Group’s eyewear expert.

ICON
Barton Perreira’s design language centers on a minimalist aesthetic, forgoing prominent logos and instead highlighting the beauty inherent in subtle elements. This includes nuanced features like the gentle contours of the acetate, designed for an optimal fit, delicate filigree engraving on titanium components, 24K gold-plated hinge details with the brand icon logo and hand-painted enamels introducing color to titanium frames.
A DEPTH OF VISION
Barton Perreira’s ideology is rooted in the creation of eyewear with a distinct soul, offering patrons a bespoke worldview through custom-colored lenses and artisanal frames handcrafted by the finest artisans in Japan. In Japan, the emphasis lies in meticulous attention to detail, ensuring each pair is executed with precision. The final feel is different. It feels like luxury. Distinguished for their passionate attention to each one-of-a-kind detail, Japan’s leading artisans ensure every facet of Barton Perreira eyewear is brought to life with precision and virtuosity.

ICON
Boldly proclaiming the New Look, the Bar jacket was unveiled at Christian Dior’s very first fashion show on February 12, 1947, affirming a timeless essence and an enduring beauty that is continually revisited. Like a work of architecture, the Bar jacket has been reinvented season after season, transcending trends and periods, an eternal icon of the House.
INSPIRATION
Christian Dior was the designer of dreams. As soon as his House was founded in 1946, and consecrated by the revolution of the New Look, his visionary spirit never ceased to glorify women all over the world. “Fabric is the sole vehicle of our dreams (…). Fashion, in sum, comes from a dream, and dreaming is an escape,” he wrote. Season after season, this exceptional heritage is reinvented by the singular creative passion, force and modernity of the House’s Creative Directors who – from haute couture to perfumes – make the Dior magic live on with audacity, excellence of savoir-faire and its unique beauty of the gesture.  
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Christian Dior’s most precious heritage, savoir-faire inspired by excellence, is celebrated in every creation crafted by the House, from haute couture to ready-to-wear, from jewelry to home accessories. Exceptional craftsmanship embodies the alchemy between the preservation of time-honored technique and perpetual innovation.
30 AVENUE MONTAIGNE
“It had to be 30, avenue Montaigne. I will set up shop here and nowhere else!” Christian Dior seemed predestined to fall for this now legendary townhouse, which became the heart of Dior, synonymous with Parisian elegance, a kingdom of dreams where continually reinvented icons were first born.

DIOR COMMITS TO RETHINKING TOMORROW'S FASHION
Nature always held a special place in the heart of Christian Dior. Perpetuating this deep admiration, the House of Dior today operates as a creative laboratory in motion, open onto the world, its challenges and its cultures, to dream up timeless, sustainable and responsible icons, with the aim of building a more desirable future.

On November 7, 1960, founders Robert Miller and Charles Feeney revolutionized travel retail when they opened the first airport store in Hong Kong.

Today, as the global leading luxury travel retailer, DFS embodies its brand promise, "Your Personal Guide to the World of Luxury," with a global network of airport and downtown stores such as Hong Kong, Macau, Hawaii. Every DFS store is a destination within destination, reflecting the founders’ passions for travel and service.

Identity
LOEWE
Steeped in art and historical references, rooted in craft and tradition, Loewe has been reinventing leather craftmanship for almost 200 years. From its birth in Madrid in 1846 to its latest collection dedicated to the elegance of Chinese monochrome ceramics, the Maison’s journey has been defined by its core values: energy, creativity, and a thoroughly modern approach blended with traditional techniques.
Craft at Loewe is unconditionally bound up with art, an endless source of inspiration: from the British Arts & Craft masters to the whimsical world of Studio Ghibli, art is at the heart of every collection – and the House is committed to supporting the artists and creators informing its work.
Today, Loewe’s master artisans combine their craft knowledge, accumulated over generations, with new technologies to produce iconic objects presenting both instant appeal and enduring style: true incarnations of Loewe’s ideals and vision.
Radical and ever-evolving: here’s to another 200 years of Loewe history
Since 2013, Jonathan Anderson, Loewe’s Creative Director, has been carrying this vision ever further. One of the leading designers of his generation, Anderson has spearheaded a major rejuvenation of the House.
Through a redesign of the brand identity, a modern articulation of its commitment to craft (with the launch of the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize, for instance), and a series of critically acclaimed and genre-defining Women’s and Men’s collections, Loewe has been further elevated as an influential and global cultural force.
At the intersection of fashion, craft and culture, Loewe’s ambition is to be radical and ever-evolving. Craft and luxury are inextricably linked, and at Loewe, the one makes the other feel more accessible and tangible. By showing how the collections are made and honouring the complex artisanal processes behind them, it becomes possible to see their value and their merit. And by adding a cultural dimension – involving fine arts, film, dance, etc. –, Loewe has become a vibrant force for creativity and innovation, ensuring the brand’s durability for another 200 years… and more.

ARCHITECTURE
Casa Loewe is the foundational concept for Loewe stores. Denoting a place of luxury, intimacy and culture, Casa Loewe is designed to feel like the townhouse of a sophisticated art collector, where Loewe fashion collections are interspersed with art, craft and design from the Loewe Collection, a growing collection built on principles of excellence, originality and craftsmanship. Casa Loewe promises a different kind of shopping experience; that of a highly refined, personal and cultural space to be explored like a private residence.

A way of thinking that marches off the beaten track. At Hublot, we go straight to the consumer instead of waiting for the consumer to come to us.

ICON
Entirely designed, manufactured and assembled in the Nyon Manufacture by Hublot micro-mechanics, engineers and watchmakers, Unico is a movement with a double coupling system visible from the dial side. Developed in 2009, its construction has been pushed to the extreme, retaining 330 components. A concentration of performance which maximizes its reliability and robustness.
INNOVATION
After several years of research, Hublot has created an actual “fusion” between pure gold and boron carbide (ceramic): an 18-carat gold alloy which is superior to traditional alloys in terms of hardness and resistance to scratches, while retaining the properties of ceramic and gold.  During the polishing phase, the untreated alloy loses its blackish color and takes on a unique gold shade, which explains its “Magic Gold” name. Exclusively produced in the Hublot Manufacture’s foundry, Magic Gold heralds a new era for precious metal alloys. In 2018, the Research & Development department succeeded in producing a particularly coveted material, namely brightly colored ceramics and, in this case, bright red ceramics.

Identity
LORO PIANA
Originally from Trivero in northern Italy, the Loro Piana family began trading wool in the early 1800s. In 1924, Pietro Loro Piana founded Ing. Loro Piana & C., the current company. Pietro’s nephew Franco took over in 1941, and after the war the firm began to establish its reputation as a supplier of premium wool and cashmere textiles for a growing haute couture industry, both home and abroad. In the 1970s, Sergio and Pier Luigi Loro Piana took up the reins, diversifying into luxury goods and developing an international retail arm. Now the world’s foremost cashmere processor, Loro Piana prides itself on sourcing the very finest, rarest raw materials the world has to offer, including unique cashmere from baby goats in northern China and Mongolia, vicuña from the Andes, extra-fine Merino wool from Australia and New Zealand and lotus flower fiber from Myanmar. The company draws on both time-honored traditions and state of the art technology to offer its discerning customers products that are renowned for their peerless quality. All of the company’s collections of ready-to-wear garments and accessories are made in Italy to the highest standards of craftsmanship and sartorial excellence.

The finest, rarest animal fiber in the world comes from the fleece of a small member of the camel family that lives wild in the Andes: the vicuña. Its story is closely bound up with that of Loro Piana, with its renowned passion for the world’s most outstanding raw materials.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Loro Piana has come to set the benchmark for the world’s finest yarns and fabrics, thanks to its tireless investments in raw materials and production, and continued technical innovation. The company controls every stage of production to its exacting standards, from the collection of the natural fibers, right down to the delivery of the finished products to its stores. Loro Piana’s commitment to the sustainability of these rare, exclusive fibers has resulted in long term conservation programs to safeguard the animals and their habitats. By forging exclusive partnerships with suppliers round the world, it supports and encourages ongoing research and development right from the source. Loro Piana uses these unique raw materials to produce its world-renowned textiles and exceptional luxury goods, which are all meticulously crafted in Italy by some of the country’s most skilful artisans. Tradition and innovation inspire the company’s uncompromising vision of quality.

Our commitment
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
The LVMH Group is using the power of its influence to galvanize the luxury industry through concrete actions and to drive far-reaching changes to help protect ecosystems. To combine sustainability and desirability, in 2020 LVMH launched LIFE 360 (LVMH Initiatives for the Environment), an action program based on quantified objectives for 2023, 2026 and 2030. It has four strategic pillars: creative circularity, biodiversity, climate, traceability and transparency.

LVMH is part of a process of continuous progress: A Water strategy adapted to the Group's businesses and an action program dedicated to supporting its suppliers have rounded out LIFE 360 since 2023. A reporting system organized by the Group's 75 Maisons makes it possible to report on the progress of these objectives, and structures LVMH’s responses to the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive). An approach facilitated by a network of nearly 200 environmental correspondents within the Maisons.

OUR STRATEGIC PILLARS
EXPANDING CIRCULAR DESIGN
To meet the LIFE 360 program’s objectives for circular design, the Group and its Maisons are introducing sustainability services — repair, refill and repurposing through second-life programs — and enhancing the ecodesign of their products and packaging. LVMH is continually upgrading its existing materials and inventing new sustainable ones.

PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY
The Group’s essential raw materials come from nature. So LVMH is seeking to identify and manage its impact on the environment more effectively. It is adopting commitments for protecting resources, regenerating ecosystems and raising awareness among both employees and the general public through education. The Group supports the introduction of regenerative agriculture and programs for preserving at-risk ecosystems, through partnerships with other organizations.

TAKING ACTION FOR THE CLIMATE
The Group’s path to decarbonization is based on operational action plans for reducing its emissions. In that spirit, LVMH and its Maisons are speeding decarbonization at its sites and stores via an energy efficiency policy and the deployment of renewable energy. The Group has also defined priorities and action plans for reducing its Scope 3 emissions, which account for 96% of its carbon footprint.

GUARANTEEING RESPONSIBLE AND TRANSPARENT VALUE CHAINS
To strengthen traceability in its supply chains, the Group relies on its policy of certification of strategic sectors, cooperation with its suppliers and participants in the luxury industry, and innovative traceability tools. To meet the growing demand for transparency, the Group participates in environmental labeling initiatives.

“All of our products come from nature: This awareness, this interaction with nature, with biodiversity, constitutes the common thread of our LIFE 360 action plan. Biodiversity, water, climate — it’s all connected.”
HÉLÈNE VALADE
LVMH ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR
LIFE ACADEMY: TRAIN TO TRANSFORM
To achieve the LIFE360 target of providing environmental training to all its employees by 2026, LVMH has set about raising awareness and teaching them the importance of looking after natural resources, conserving biodiversity and preventing climate change. In 2023, the Group designed environmental training courses tailored to the specific nature of each of its various businesses. To make this broader commitment possible, LVMH created the LIFE Academy educational hub to provide a range of training in both general and more specialized environmental topics. On each topic, the LIFE Academy equips employees with the skills needed to lead that transformation, with the aim of spurring the workforce to action.

ICON
Created by Georges Louis Vuitton in 1896 as a tribute to his father, the Monogram canvas, a highly coveted material that quickly became a sign of distinction and rarity. Today, the Monogram motif provides endless inspiration for contemporary re-interpretations by Louis Vuitton’s own Artistic Directors as well as artistic visionaries.
INSPIRATIONS
Born out of an unquenchable thirst for exploration, Louis Vuitton carries on its founder’s values of savoir-faire, creativity and innovation. With the advent of new modes of travel, Louis Vuitton creates cutting-edge designs, materials and ergonomics adapted to specific demands of the journey and the travelers, developing new expertise in increasingly varied fields. Always the pioneer and never afraid of distant horizons, the Maison continues to accompany its clientele wherever they dream of traveling to discover unknown territories.

Widowed at 20 years old, Françoise-Joséphine de Lur Saluces found herself responsible for the family estate and developed the reputation of Yquem wine beyond the borders of the kingdom of France. When she died in 1851, the Countess left her grandson with one of the most successful properties in Bordeaux.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Château d’Yquem is an extraordinary place, nestled at the top of the hills of Sauternes, bearing a hundred hectares of vineyards planted upon a mosaic of soils. All these conditions come together to yield a grape where Botrytis cinerea reveals its most valuable feature. Thanks to the process of sublimation, the grapes contain flavors and aromas that are unique in the world. This miracle is made possible by the dedication of experienced pickers, who carry their ancestral expertise from the generations that preceded them. As a result, only the best grapes, sublimated byBotrytis cinerea, are picked, because this is Yquem’s golden rule: never look for simplicity or shortcuts and risk losing everything. This is the price we pay for excellence.

Identity
CHEVAL DES ANDES
Founded in 1999 in one of Argentina’s best renowned regions – Luján de Cuyo in the north of Mendoza – Cheval des Andes spans an exceptional area of ungrafted old Malbec vines blended with Cabernet Sauvignon. This unique terroir, located in the foothills of the Andes cordillera, gives rise to the production of a fresh and elegant Andes grand cru that promises to age well. The “millésime effect” then gives its uniqueness to every vintage. Each grape variety is planted in a carefully-selected terroir so that it can reveal its full potential.
Today, the vision of committed viticulturists, helped by the knowledge of the teams of Château Cheval Blanc, has been achieved through twenty years of daily care in these unique vineyards which now produce a genuine “grand cru” of the Andes.
Through the years and over several vintages a certain style has taken shape. Initially meant to be a Bordeaux style wine, it is in fact very Argentine. An Argentine which gallops though time, travelling with elegance. This wine has its own particular character

ICON
Cheval des Andes 2010 is made from a unique blend of three grape varieties: malbec, cabernet sauvignon and petit verdot. Each hand-picked grape is fermented in oak barrels for 18 months before being blended. This vintage is defined by its aromatic complexity and elegant tannins; a subtle combination of freshness, balance and ripeness.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
As is the case with all ‘grands crus’, Cheval des Andes originates from a great ‘terroir’. But it is also the fruit of precise and meticulous viticulture. The vineyards are managed plot by plot according to the soil, grape variety, age, fertility and other factors in order to produce the very best grapes.
Our team of winegrowers understands, observes and manages each individual vine in order to achieve a ripe and homogenous harvest throughout the vineyard. Always with one vision: Time is an ally for a great wine allowing it to become refined and reach perfection whilst still remaining proud of its roots. As the vision is accomplished, the edges are polished; freshness, balance and complexity become the cornerstones of Cheval des Andes. Its style becomes elegant, blending is perfected and the wine promises to age well.

DARE
“Disrupt, Act, Risk to be an Entrepreneur”
DARE – Disrupt, Act, Risk to be an Entrepreneur – is the LVMH Group’s intrepreneurial program, launched in 2017.
DARE channels LVMH’s entrepreneurial spirit, inviting every one of the Group’s talents to suggest innovative ideas that can be turned into concrete solutions.
DARE offers our talents an opportunity to contribute directly to the Group’s growth and transformation.
DARE figures at the heart of LVMH’s entrepreneurial vision. The fast-growing DARE community already counts over 15,000 people from every Maison, métier and region across the Group.
The DARE collaborative platform is open to everyone, encouraging people to pitch innovative ideas, share with colleagues and collaborate. The thousands of ideas posted represent a tremendous opportunity to leverage the collective intelligence available within LVMH.
Frequent DARE events – both in-person and online – give participating employees the tools and methodologies they need to drive their projects forward. Throughout their project, they are guided by mentors, including CEOs of LVMH Maisons and outside experts, to assist them in refining their business model, testing their prototype and preparing their final pitch. This approach provides a unique opportunity for participants to see how their project stands up under the discerning appraisal of seasoned experts.
Following each session, future intrapreneurs are invited to pitch their project to a jury comprising LVMH Group executives, joined by outside experts and entrepreneurs. The winning teams are supported by LVMH sponsors to guide them as they develop their project.
The program has already led to the launch and acceleration of some 52 innovative projects, including Nona Source – the first ever resale platform for fabrics and leathers from leading French fashion houses) – and Heristoria, a platform that curates and sells iconic vintage products from LVMH Maisons.

ICON
The first automatic chronograph movement in history with an accuracy of 1/10th of a second, the El Primero movement was released in 1969, becoming an emblematic milestone in watchmaking that has won countless awards. Over forty years later, Zenith timepieces are still equipped with this caliber and its extraordinary mechanism.
ARCHITECTURE
The first industrial watchmaking manufacture in the modern sense of the term, the Zenith Manufacture, located in the region of Le Locle, the cradle of Swiss watchmaking, looks out over the mountains of Neuchâtel. In a place steeped in history, the Manufacture has employed a revolutionary workflow system based on vertical integration since it was founded in 1865. From design to production, each Zenith watch contains a movement that, once assembled, contains between 150 and 1,000 components. This feat is made possible thanks to close daily cooperation between artisans and specialists, all working together under one roof in the interests of efficiency, and above all to ensure our independence. The characteristic architecture of the Zenith Manufacture boasts a distinctive facade of red and white-painted bricks that proudly spell out the name of the brand with the star symbol, and the letters G.F.J., the initials of our founder. This internationally-renowned Manufacture has moved boldly into the 21st century and today counts 18 buildings on the same site. Faithful to its origins and its values, Zenith has never left the premises where it was founded. Discover the Manufacture with the immersive Zenith 360° Virtual Experience:

OUR MODEL
LVMH's mission is to ensure the development of each of its Maisons by providing them with all the resources they need to create, manufacture and distribute products and services that prioritize outstanding quality and the highest ethical, social and environmental standards.
DECENTRALIZED
ORGANIZATION
The way LVMH work guarantees that our Maisons are autonomous and reactive. This allows them to form close links with customers, to ensure that quick, effective and fair decisions can be made, and that the Group’s employees are motivated in the long term, which encourages them to put their entrepreneurial spirit into practice.
INTERNAL
GROWTH
The LVMH Group gives priority to internal growth and is committed to doing everything in its power to develop its Maisons and to encourage and protect creativity. The employees are integral to this model, and supporting them throughout their careers and giving them the opportunity to develop is essential.
VERTICAL
INTEGRATION
In order to foster excellence from top to bottom, vertical integration helps to manage all the aspects of the value chain, from sources of supply to selective retailing, not forgetting manufacturing equipment. This management means that the images of our Maisons are strictly controlled.
IMPLEMENTATION
OF SYNERGIES
The sharing of resources on a Group scale to create intelligent synergies is carried out with respect for the identity and independence of the Maisons. The combined strength that LVMH represents as a Group must be able to benefit each of its Maisons individually.
SUSTAINING
SAVOIR-FAIRE
To preserve the identity and excellence of the Maisons, LVMH has set up a number of initiatives to help them share their savoir-faire and promote craftsmanship and design among the younger generations and people undergoing professional retraining organized around LVMH Métiers d'Excellence.
INNOVATION DEDICATED
TO EXCELLENCE
LVMH owes its long-term success to its pursuit of excellence. In an ever-changing world, innovation is a powerful tool for achieving this, making our products ever more appealing and the experiences we offer our customers ever more unforgettable. Driven by our employees, innovation is based on several pillars: our in-house R&D centers, our network of start-ups, our partnerships with the world of academia and numerous expert companies.
BALANCE ACROSS BUSINESS SEGMENTS
AND GEOGRAPHIES
LVMH's success is based on the richness of its activities and its extensive global presence. Present in all luxury sectors and in 81 countries, the Group maintains a balance between diversity of activities, desirability of products and international scope, guaranteeing its continued development and giving it resilience in the face of crises and economic fluctuations.

ICON
Ideal for sipping on its own, over a large ice cube or in cocktails, Eminente Reserva possesses the aesthetics of a traditional Cuban light rum but with the complexity and depth of a very old one. Eminente Reserva has a nose that is both intense and delicate. Full-bodied and incredibly deep, the palate is rich with smoky notes of coffee, chocolate and almonds. 
EMINENTE IS COMMITTED TO NATURE AND THE PEOPLE OF CUBA
The island of Cuba is considered “the green lungs” of the West Indies. Since its founding, Eminente has nurtured close links with Cuba’s pristine nature, including the bottle and logo. Eminente has developed vertical gardens in the center of Havana and supports a community agriculture initiative in partnership with a farm that practices biodynamic agriculture, anchoring its engagement with its homeland.

For 187 years, Tiffany’s iconic collections have helped an ever-changing world speak the ever-changing language of love. Its quintessential designs—Lock, T, HardWear, Knot, Sixteen Stone and the Tiffany® Setting—embody Tiffany’s relentless pursuit of excellence in craft and creativity. Drawing on the House’s rich history, each design is a powerful expression of love.

ARCHITECTURE
Marking the first holistic renovation of the Tiffany & Co. flagship on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue in nearly a century, The Landmark was unveiled in April 2023. Visionary architect Peter Marino reimagined The Landmark’s interior architecture.
Nearly 40 unique artworks by renowned artists including Daniel Arsham, Jenny Holzer and Rashid Johnson are featured within the store, alongside never-before-seen jewels, exclusive designs and immersive displays that span across 10 floors.
A cultural hub at the epicenter of New York City, the store sets a new bar for luxury retail on a global scale.
SUSTAINABILITY
For over 25 years, Tiffany has been at the vanguard of sustainable luxury. Through The Tiffany & Co. Foundation, it helps preserve the world’s landscapes and seascapes. With its Diamond Craft Journey, Tiffany leads the industry in diamond traceability. In addition, the House’s steadfast belief that inclusiveness should never be a luxury is embedded in its social impact platform, Tiffany Atrium.
INSPIRATION
The House’s legacy of discovery and exploration was fueled by Mr. Tiffany’s passion for acquiring rare colored gemstones. Unveiled in 1878, the Tiffany Diamond remains one of the largest and most celebrated fancy yellow diamonds in the world.
Building upon its reputation as “The Diamond Kings,” in 1887 Tiffany purchased nearly one-third of the French Crown Jewels. The rare gemstones were set in Tiffany designs and offered to its clients.
Today, Tiffany continues to lead the industry, offering a triple excellent cut on all round brilliant engagement diamonds—the highest standard for a diamond’s cut, polish and symmetry.

Veuve Clicquot has an exceptional oenological heritage, which features the largest palette of reserve wines. It can be traced back directly to the vision of an exceptional woman with a passion for Pinot Noir. I’m delighted to perpetuate more than two centuries of expertise and excellence, and to design iconic cuvées such as Brut Yellow Label and La Grande Dame.

ICON
From the moment she first took over the House, Madame Clicquot was anything but a figurehead. She was a leader and an inventor, driven by her sense of creation and excellence. One of the first businesswomen of modern times, Madame Clicquot tirelessly conquered new markets and ultimately earned a name of great respect from her peers: la grande dame of Champagne.
SOCIETAL COMMITMENT
The House was avant-garde in launching the Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Award in 1972 to highlight female entrepreneurs. Since then, 450 women in 27 countries have been honored. Today, Bold by Veuve Clicquot, is a concrete international program designed for more impact, with multiple actions around the world and the Bold Woman Award at the heart of it all. With the creation of the first global open database for women entrepreneurs, the Bold Open Data Base, its commitment goes even further – to increase women visibility across the globe.
“Our Maison has worked alongside women entrepreneurs for so many years, but there is still work to do. So we must speak even louder, go faster, and take action.”

Identity
LES ECHOS
When in 1908 Emile and Robert Servan-Schreiber embarked on a journalistic adventure and published the first issue of what was to become Les Echos, the newspaper was not yet a daily. Under its original title of Les Echos de l’Exportation, the publication was a vehicle for promoting the family business, which was specialized in the exportation of hardware and haberdashery. It was only twenty years later that the monthly four-page publication became a daily and adopted the name by which we know it today. Immediately taken up by the decision-makers of the time, it became a reference publication in the financial press. Over a century later, Les Echos has maintained this privileged status. The only daily newspaper printed in France to be specialized in business news, it offers its readership all the keys required to make a decision. This offer is now available in all digital formats, on its website and social networks as well as on tablets and smartphones.Les Echos also offers multiple solutions intended for businesses.

Identity
KENZO
Kenzo has been infusing positive energy and contagious freedom for half a century by boldly proclaiming a polychrome, daring and borderless fashion that celebrates nature and cultural diversity. Founded in Paris in 1970 by Kenzo Takada, who opened his first boutique in Galerie Vivienne in Paris, the House continues to cultivate and reinterpret codes that make it unique with dynamic modernity: a mix of prints and harmony of refined colors and an exuberant and sophisticated creativity imbued with optimism and impertinence.
In September 2021 Kenzo embarked on a new chapter in its history with the naming of Nigo as the House’s new Artistic Director.

ARCHITECTURE
The history of 18 rue Vivienne, Kenzo’s current head office, is filled with sudden developments and famous owners. This now legendary address is located a short distance from the Galerie Vivienne that was home to the House’s first Parisian boutique in 1970. In 1640, Jacques Coquet, the treasurer of France and controller-general of finances for Paris, asked the architect Pierre Le Muet to build him a mansion with two wings, one looking out onto the street and the other between a courtyard and a garden.
Through exchanges, sales, division and inheritance, it passed from owner to owner, including the Marquis de Mallebois, Master of Requests and Colbert’s nephew, the Marquis de Fontenay-Trésigny, war minister under Louis XV, before becoming, in a fitting twist of fate, a House selling silk and wool. Shaped by time, 18 rue Vivienne today houses most of the Kenzo departments, including the studio, the workshop, the support functions and product development, and today powerfully embodies the House’s spirit.

Identity
CHÂTEAU CHEVAL BLANC
Château Cheval Blanc is first and foremost an exceptionally rich terroir featuring a patchwork of different soils. From its position between Saint-Emilion and Pomerol, in the heart of the Bordeaux vineyards, the estate has established its identity through the gravel and clay soils which are closely interwoven over the 45 parcels that make up the estate. Cabernet Franc and Merlot, two grape varieties that complement each other perfectly, grow in harmony throughout the 39 hectares of vineyard. The House’s savoir-faire, its ability to garner the terroir’s full potential, and its bold choices of grape varieties give Cheval Blanc wine all its freshness, elegance, power and finesse. They provide a unique character and a rare potential for aging: Cheval Blanc wines are excellent at any stage, but improve year after year. This cellaring potential and timeless style, which is recreated every year according to the assets of each vintage, have ensured the the supreme distinction of the 1er Grand Cru Classé A classification since 1954.
A combination of hard work, soil type, carefully selected grape varieties and an ideal climate, Cheval Blanc is a rare dream, a handcrafted treasure. In this world, where each detail is a step towards perfection, technology never dictates human behavior.  Every day, we strive to improve and enhance the extraordinary qualities of this living heritage.

Undoubtedly one of the most famous vintages of the 20th century, Château Cheval Blanc 1947 is the result of exceptionnal weather conditions for vines in 1947 (perfect fine weather from April to October). It is a wine with extraordinary aromas that leave tasters speechless and an endless finish that is unparalleled.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
Every year, through the subtle magic of blending, a new page is written in the story of Château Cheval Blanc. The creation of the vintage begins at the end of summer, when the grapes, picked at optimum ripeness, give life to as many wines as there are parcels. Each of them has a unique personality, and will be left for several months in new oak barrels, which preserve their character. At the start of spring, after several months of fermentation, the wines are tasted one by one. Only 15 to 35 of them will be selected to make the grand vin, and for this there is only one criterion: excellence. The painstaking process that is the art of blending involves deciding on the proportions of each wine that will go into making that year’s vintage. This vintage, the finesse, length and balance of which are exceptional, will then be left to age for a year in the barrel house. A reinterpretation of the Cheval Blanc legend.

Identity
MINUTY
Founded in 1936 by Gabriel Farnet, Château Minuty is the fruit of a family whose history is deeply rooted in the values of authenticity and respect for the land. Located in Gassin, in the heart of the Saint-Tropez peninsula, nestled between land and sea, the 200-hectare estate has been awarded HVE environmental certification, level three. Blending tradition and innovation, the estate employs sustainable agriculture practices in its vineyards.
One of the last estates in the Côtes de Provence to harvest grapes by hand, Minuty preserves artisanal savoir-faire that has been passed down over four generations. This rich heritage is expressed in the crafting of its exceptional rosé, white and red wines, all renowned for their unique balance of finesse and aromatic complexity.
Made from Grenache and Tiburon grape varieties, the rosés are elegantly seductive. The white wines, made from Role grapes, and the reds, from Syrah and Mourvèdre, express the richness of local grape varieties and the minerality of the terroir, ensuring wines of remarkable quality.

Château Minuty Or, the estate’s emblematic range, is produced in three colors: Rose et Or, Blanc et Or, and Rouge et Or. In less than a decade, the “Or” (meaning “gold”) range has become Château Minuty’s signature. Thanks to meticulous plot selection, these cuvées stand out for their delicacy and elegance. All the grapes are sourced from the estate itself and harvested by hand, guaranteeing estate-grown wines of exceptional quality.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
The exceptional Château Minuty wines are the fruit of ancestral savoir-faire, coupled with state-of-the-art technologies. Everything begins in the vineyard, where the soil is naturally enriched and the vines cultivated using sustainable practices, without herbicides or pesticides, ensuring that the natural ecosystem is carefully preserved. Harvesting is 100% by hand, ensuring the impeccable condition of the grapes, while meticulous vinification in a controlled atmosphere retains the complex aromas. Every stage in the process from vine to bottle is guided by precision and an unwavering quest for quality.

Identity
RIMOWA
It is not only the ambition to craft exceptional luggage but also the courage to question the status quo that lies at the heart of everything RIMOWA does. Since its founding by Paul Morszeck in 1898, RIMOWA has cultivated the pioneering spirit that is evident in every suitcase built. Inheriting his father’s visionary approach, it was Richard Morszeck who – inspired by the early days of aviation – discovered grooved aluminium as the ideal lightweight material for RIMOWA suitcases. A design classic was born. With the same ingenuity and courage as his father and grandfather, third generation owner Dieter Morszeck paved the way for RIMOWA’s global success. Thanks to his focus on state-of-the-art technology, uncompromising quality and timeless design, RIMOWA suitcases have become the global companion of choice for a sophisticated clientele. Today, with 3,000 employees worldwide, RIMOWA continues to combine craftmanship with precision technology and a commitment to courageous innovation, staying true to its heritage in today’s ever-changing world.

ICON
At RIMOWA, we say aluminium has Persönlichkeit, or personality. As it ages, it evolves. It’s a material that reflects the character of those that use it, a record of a personal journey. Designed in Germany, our suitcases have recorded our life in Cologne. And although they’re made by our hands – with every dent, scratch, and sticker – they’re defined by yours.
INSPIRATION
Besides courage and curiosity, every pioneering idea is closely bound to its very own source of inspiration. At RIMOWA, it is the legendary JUNKERS F13 – the world’s first all-metal passenger aircraft. A symbol for a new era of travelling, constructed by visionary engineer Hugo Junkers in 1919.
It is not only the lightweight aluminium with its iconic groove design that inspired RIMOWA, but at the same time Hugo Junkers’ legacy of uniting people and nations that continues to shape the RIMOWA brand today.

Identity
MARC JACOBS
Marc Jacobs created Marc Jacobs International with Robert Duffy in 1984, basing the brand on two very simple concepts: a love of fashion and a commitment to quality. Finding the perfect balance between tradition and innovation, highlighting Jacobs’ exuberant creativity, the brand has become a driving force in the industry. With the addition of Marc by Marc Jacobs in 2001, Marc Jacobs International now offers two complete lines of ready-to-wear and accessories. Part of a generation that’s conscious of the world around it, sensitive to humanitarianism and social entrepreneurship, Marc Jacobs has made its mark as rebellious, unpredictable, original, unique, and authentic all at the same time. Committed to the communities around them, Marc Jacobs International leads by example, supporting over 75 charities and organizations around the world.
I am neither an American nor a French designer; I am just a designer.  We have a real freedom to explore and collaborate with those around us.  We’re constantly rethinking and reinventing ourselves.

ICON
In 1984 Marc Jacobs launched his first collection under his brand and became the youngest designer to receive the New Fashion Talent award granted by the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA). Influenced by all areas of culture, Jacobs was artistic director at Louis Vuitton for 16 years from 1997 to 2013.
MUSE
“Young and sweet and innocent and beautiful. The epitome of the girl I fantasize about.” Sofia Coppola and Marc Jacobs have collaborated personally and artistically numerous times since they became friends in the early ’90s. The famous writer and director perfectly embodies the brand’s arty spirit. The designer’s confidant and muse appeared in the 2001 advertisement for the very first handbag collection from Marc Jacobs, and directed the ad for the brand’s latest perfume, Daisy Dream.

The Time Fast D8 plunges us into the breathtaking world of Formula One race tracks of the 1950s. Designed entirely in-house, this timepiece is inspired by vintage race cars, featuring striking details that evoke Formula One cars of bygone eras and childhood memories. With the Manufacture’s signature playful touch of humor, the time is set using the three-spoke steering wheel, a nod to long ago memories when mechanical pullback cars were powered by being pulled backwards and then released. 
SAVOIR-FAIRE INTEGRATED IN THE MANUFACTURE  
The L’Epee 1839 Manufacture is home to a comprehensive range of métiers and artisans, bringing together all the expertise needed, from development of movements to component manufacture, whether hand-crafted or made by specially designed automatic machines for large dimensions. High-precision, horological details are especially complex, and require exceptional savoir-faire given the expanse of the surfaces, much vaster than those of a wristwatch.

Built in 2004, Ecstasea is the longest vessel ever built by Royal Van Lent. Boasting a top speed of over 30 knots, the challenge was to design a hull capable of withstanding this speed while preserving the elegance unique to Royal Van Lent. This ultimate blend of performance and refinement is the House's signature.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
In 2001, the Van Lent shipyard received the prestigious Dutch title “Royal” from the Queen of the Netherlands. This distinction is awarded to companies that meet exemplary criteria, as much in terms of the quality of their products as the behavior of their staff, their social responsibility and their environmental impact. A “royal” business must be impeccable in both its past – it must have been in the same family for at least a century – and its future projects. The awarding of this status, which places Van Lent alongside the leading names in Dutch industry, is an immense source of pride for the shipyard and all its staff.

Each curve of the Gentissima Oursin embodies unrestricted creativity and elegance. It was designed to travel through every facet of emotions to connect art and life. The Gentissima Oursin is the ultimate companion of freedom, crafted to celebrate extraordinary moments. All models play with contrasts to seduce the eyes and are finished in a hidden octagonal shape, Mr. Genta’s favorite shape.

INSPIRATION
Gérald Genta was known for his pursuit of the extraordinary. His impact went beyond haute horlogerie and took risks with statement designs, while others focused on traditional mechanical or quartz watches. Master Watchmakers Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini recall Mr. Genta’s flamboyant yet natural artistic approach that reignited global interest in watchmaking. Today, the brand creates unique capsule collections and limited editions, embracing bold design and modernity, honoring Mr. Genta’s visionary spirit. Through wrist-worn art, it revives and reinterprets the Gérald Genta DNA into whimsical horological creations.

Identity
COVA
In 1817, Cova first opened its doors next to the famed Teatro alla Scala in the fashionable centre of Milan. Born as a literary café, Cova emerged as one of the most important historical openings of the era. A fashionable café for post-theatre rendez-vous and the meeting place for patriots of the Risorgimento, Cova hosted the élite of the busy, high society. Caffé Cova soon became the preferred  locale for  world famous artists such as Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini. In the 1950’s, Cova relocated to Via Montenapoleone at the heart of Milan’s booming fashion district where it continued to pursue the prestigious tradition of Italian know-how.
Today, with a rich heritage crossing two centuries, Cova is an institution that celebrates tailored craftsmanship and creativity. Entering Cova is experiencing a timeless ceremony where experienced chefs meticulously prepare fine products, elegant waiters host an immediate feeling of a warm welcome and where the fashion crowd, businessmen and a cosmopolitan clientele come to indulge in the unique atmosphere of Cova, the time capsule of Italian tradition.
Cova is synonymous with Milan and represents a taste of Italian excellence in the art of food and pastrywherever you are in the world. Today, whether in Milan, Shanghai, Hong-Kong, Montecarlo, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Greece or in Paris – and soon other trendsetting capital cities – entering Cova means unveiling a world where craftsmanship blends harmoniously with creativity and impeccable service.

ICON
Jealously guarded since the beginning of the 19th century, the Cova panettone recipe has been passed secretly from generation to generation. With exquisite ingredients including flour, yeast, butter, eggs and dried fruits, this iconic pastry is a symbol of the festive season, the convivial art of eating together and the joy that comes with unwrapping a delectable ornately-wrapped gift.
ARCHITECTURE
The inspiration for Cova’s architecture begins with a glimpse of the past. Drawing inspiration from the original Cova, the design hints a series of codes: a strong colour, a distinctive pattern and a central masterpiece – the bancone bar. The magnificent signature installation will lie at the heart of the Cova experience, a high splendid counter where guests are beckoned to sip a morning cappuccino or an afternoon espresso or enjoy a stunning Italian aperitivo. Located inside the prestigious neoclassical courtyard designed at the end of the 18thcentury by Giuseppe Piermarini, the Cova Garden is an enchanting dehors that is configured as a courtyard in the courtyard and it is the result of a modern transposition of the neoclassical characteristics of the building.

ICON
Ernest Cognacq and Marie-Louise Jaÿ marked the history of retail commerce. The couple quickly demonstrated remarkable business acumen, creating a retail empire whose reputation stretched well beyond France.
Ernest Cognacq opened his first shop on Rue du Pont-Neuf. Near the Les Halles marketplace, the neighborhood was popular among strollers and workers who crossed the bridge each day. Ernest drew crowds with his amusing stories and quickly earned a reputation as the best salesman in the neighborhood.
Later, he and Marie-Louise decided to open a bigger store on the corner of Rue de la Monnaie and Rue du Pont Neuf. They named it “La Samaritaine”. Customers flowed in by the hundreds. The store was a huge success and the beginning of a grand adventure….
INSPIRATION
Samaritaine had to close in 2005 for safety reasons. The LVMH Group decided to launch an ambitious renovation project as part of the transformation of this famous Paris neighborhood, a vital green space in the heart of the capital with numerous pedestrian streets, as well as an art hub, as numerous galleries opened.
Supported by a striking metal framework, the glass roof, created in 1907, constitutes a spectacular architectural element, requiring meticulous care during the restoration. After being modified and even covered for a period, the rectangular roof has been returned to its original majestic form.
Spanning 3.5 meters in height and 115 meters in length, the stunning peacock fresco that runs beneath the glass roof is considered a masterpiece of Art Nouveau. Created by Francis Jourdain, the son of the Art Nouveau building’s architect Frantz Jourdain, the fresco has been restored to the vibrant colors of its heyday thanks to the expert work of numerous artisans.
SERVICES
The lower level of Samaritaine is home to Europe’s largest beauty retail space, featuring prestigious names in fragrances, makeup and skincare, as well as the Cinq Mondes Spa and a special concept dedicated to niche fragrances.
There are also talented experts for personalized hairdressing and manicure services in the Studio de Beauté. Makeup services, skin assessments and treatment cabins are all invitations to indulge in a few moments of well-being.

How to use perfume

“A good perfume adapts – to the person and to the personality. It must neither precede nor follow the wearer too intensely; it should never emanate imperiously. This ensures that the perfume is never overpowering and will appeal to everyone. It is given a gentle breath on the wrist, in the movement of the hair and the air which this movement creates. Both modest and faithful, it imposes nothing. persistent, it is never tenacious, but politely perceptible.”

Inspired by this adage, L’Eau Triple, the iconic water-based perfume created by Officine Universelle Buly, reveals pure and delicate scents without ever destabilizing the balance of the skin.
PERFECTION IS NOT A DETAIL
Details are always a priority at Officine Universelle Buly. Intimately attached and faithful to French savoir-faire, the Maison’s personalization service transforms each product into a precious case.
The Officine’s preparation assistants calligraph, engrave, emboss and package each creation with meticulous patience, like a signature, highlighted in gold, embodying the Buly philosophy: unique, precious and authentic.

CEO
Arnaud de Saignes
Creation date
1959

Since 1959, CHANDON opens up a world of possibilities. Spanning four continents, we craft exceptional sparkling wines in unexpected lands. With six wineries in Argentina, California, Brazil, Australia, China and India, ours is the largest sparkling vineyard worldwide and the only domain with roots all over the world.
Identity
CHANDON
More than sixty years ago, Robert Jean de Vogüé, at the time President of Moët & Chandon, and a handful of other exceptional individuals had the vision, courage and drive to redefine luxury sparkling wine.
They realized that there was a way to make it modern; and that was to take it far, far from home, exporting their centuries old know how, not the bottles. What they created was a thrilling paradox: a heritage brand with dynamism in its DNA. CHANDON.
Now spanning four continents, we have wineries in Argentina, California, Brazil, Australia, China and India, making ours the largest sparkling vineyard worldwide and the only domain on which the sun never sets.
Drawing on a collaborative network of sixteen winemakers of seven different nationalities, we stand for new terroirs, innovative methods and an ever-curious outlook that happily unites our diverse lands and people. CHANDON opens up a world of possibilities.

Identity
WOODINVILLE
The story of Woodinville doesn’t begin with a 100-year-old recipe or generations of family distillers. It begins with two best friends and a dream.
The dream is to make the greatest craft whiskey in the world by bringing the time-honored traditions of bourbon production into a craft environment — using the highest quality locally grown grains, the best barrels and coopers in the world, the most technologically advanced distilling equipment, and the mentorship of the late, great, industry icon, David Pickerell.
And while the story is still unfolding, after being awarded “Craft Whiskey of the Year” and “Craft Rye Whiskey of the Year”, two years in a row by the American Distilling Institute and being named “Best Straight Bourbon Whiskey of 2020” at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, things are headed in the right direction.
By sourcing our grain directly from one small farm and producing our products entirely by hand, we have control over every step of the production process. This ensures the utmost quality and consistency in every barrel of Woodinville that we produce.

Every step of Woodinville’s production is done entirely by hand from cooking of the mash to bottling the whiskey. All of the grain is grown by the Omlin family on their small, 3rd generation family farm in Quincy, Washington.

Identity
LOEWE PERFUMES
LOEWE Perfumes adds a multisensory dimension to LOEWE via a kaleidoscopic range of iconic fragrances for men, for women and for the home that combine vibrant, nature-inspired olfactory experiences with bold visual expression.
In 1972, LOEWE launched its first women’s fragrance: L de Loewe. Because of its success, the House began investing in international perfumery retail. LOEWE Perfumes has kept sustaining the brand’s Spanish legacy, artisanal savoir-faire and innovative spirit guided, since 2013, by the creative vision of Jonathan Anderson, LOEWE’s Creative Director, in partnership with in-house perfumier, Nuria Cruelles.
Encompassing the Botanical Rainbow—nine iconic fragrance families that translate the depth and variety of Nature’s inspiration into the medium of perfume—and LOEWE Home Scents—twelve plant portraits capturing the authentic essences of a vegetable garden—plus the ever-expanding, hedonistic Paula’s Ibiza fragrance families and the Un Paseo Por Madrid collection, LOEWE Perfumes creates a multisensory kaleidoscope of colour, scent and emotion, inspired by nature.

ARCHITECTURE
The mix of craft, innovation and nature lies at the heart of all LOEWE Perfumes’ collections. In 2022, a fresh evolution of LOEWE’s signature CASA LOEWE flagship retail concept, conceived by Jonathan Anderson, arrived with a new experience of shopping for LOEWE Perfumes. Each store evokes the cool objectivity of a botanist’s archive, blending the scientists’ pragmatism with a passion for nature at its most elemental. An environment designed to inspire all visitors to explore and build their own unique Botanical Rainbow of fragrance.
SAVOIR-FAIRE
‘Craft is the essence of LOEWE,’ says LOEWE creative director, Jonathan Anderson ‘It is where our modernity lies, and it will always be relevant’.
Honouring this commitment to craft is one of LOEWE Perfumes’ core values, guiding both our internal creative process and informing our engagement with culture in the wider world.
Through a perennial love of craft, LOEWE Perfumes safeguards traditions while continually daring to innovate, infusing every element—from the perfumers’ art to the design of our bottles and visual identity— in the making of modern and disruptive olfactory experiences.
